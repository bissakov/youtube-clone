They must now juggle treating each other like rabid apes with holding onto their childhood. The solution? Playing the older games, it’s frankly the only reason most of us continue to purchase the newer games. A diminishing hope that maybe this time we will get a return to what made our memories so good, a return to quality, a return to what Assassin’s Creed is. Because surely, Assassin’s Creed isn’t about vikings or spartans, it’s about Assassin’s. But perhaps that very identity, one that becomes blurier with each new entry, as it adds a gaussian to the legacy of these games, isn’t as clear as we once thought.\n\n The Assassin’s Creed games have been anything but consistent, and as I’ve replayed the games I have found myself struggling to nail an identity to Assassin’s Creed, which is something I’ve never faced before. Growing up, the Assassin’s Creed games have always had an identity in movement, finesse, charm, and maturity. It’s these qualities that made me appreciate the first 4 entries and to an extent the 3rd game. Even if looking back I realised the games aren’t as good as I remember, the sentiment is the same, I have fond memories of collecting all those damn feathers, and sneaking down to the basement in the middle of the night to upgrade my villa, praying that the floorboards don’t creak loud enough to wake my parents. It’s this very mindset that made me reject Assassin’s Creed IV. It wasn’t an Assassin’s Creed game, it was a pirate game. This is a flawed mindset, and one that initially challenged me when I actually played Black Flag. There was so much here that I thought I wouldn’t like that, when I did eventually play it over a year after its release, I was blown away at how much of a fool I was. \n\nThis game wasn’t a traditional Assassin’s Creed game… it was better. This game made me realise that I have to try something before I knock it, and while there are still some Assassin’s Creed games I don’t want to go back to, Valhalla I’m looking at you, it’s worth taking a chance because this might actually be my favourite Assassin’s Creed game, period. So let’s talk about the game, it’s identity, the series identity, and what this game means to the Assassin’s Creed Legacy. This time, we travel to the West Indies with a band of pirates who are jacks of the same trade and serve one master, gold. While Edward might be on the cover, do not mistake yourselves, the main character here is gold. Greed is the main antagonist and it’s Edwards consistent battle against his own greed and that of others that eventually leads him to the middle of an ideological war zone between two factions we know all too well. This fight prompts Edward to finally mature, even if it is at the cost of everyone and everything. But rather than stalking from the shadows as an Assassin frequently does, Edward prefers a louder approach, that involves a lot more liquor, and a hell of a lot more gunpowder. Through this swashbuckling spyglass lens we see something we've never seen before, the Assassin Templar conflict, from an outsiders view, and an outsider that couldn’t care less. \n\n- Chapters -\nIntroduction: 0:00\nCh. 1: Jumping Ship: 10:43\nCh. 2: Tails of Culture: 22:01\nCh. 3: Assassin Shackles: 40:54\nCh. 4: Not an AC Game: 56:16\nPost-Script: 1:09:27\n\nBlack Flag is NOT an Assassin's Creed Game.

This Assassin's Creed Black Flag retrospective will answer what is The best Assassin's Creed Game, as it is one of the last games in my Assassin's Creed retrospective. I know many of you have been waiting for a That Boy Aqua Black Flag video so here it is. I didn't want to go with a Assassin's Creed Black Flag Years Later video as I use this game more as a vehicle to discuss what makes an Assassin's Creed game an Assassin's Creed game. This is still a Assassin's Creed IV critique, AC IV review, AC IV critique, and a majority of the video is an Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag critique, an Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag review, and an Assassin's Creed analysis.

While its premise was strange and easy to make fun of, Kingdom Hearts 1 was an incredibly ambitious game. It managed to translate the turn-based combat of a final fantasy game into a real-time action game setting rather effortlessly and the Disney coat of paint served as a solid backdrop to levels. This strange combination of ideas made the game instantly stand out. Not just from Square’s own library, but in the entire gaming industry. Combine this with a solid amount of content, a beautiful soundtrack, and a cheesy but charming story and you end up with a game that, might not have aged well in a few areas, but is better than the sum of its parts and deserves to be recognized as a classic. What’s most impressive to me, however, is that the story had a somewhat downer of an ending for this kind of game. You would expect a game tied so heavily to Disney to have a happy ending where everyone gets what they want in the end, but that’s not entirely the case. Sure, Ansem was defeated and the many worlds were saved, but our trio's main goals went unfulfilled. Riku and King Mickey end up staying on the other side of Kingdom Hearts, and Sora is once again separated from Kairi. There’s a sense of melancholy that you wouldn’t expect and this feeling is carried over into the game’s direct sequel.\n\n0:00 Ad Read.\n1:31 Opening.\n6:01 Kingdom Hearts 2's Introduction.\n10:00 Combat Analysis.\n27:05 World Design & Optional Content.\n34:22 Story Analysis.\n45:25 Conclusion.\n47:04 Outro & Supporter Credits.\n\n#AD  #KingdomHearts #Review\n\nKingdom Hearts 2 - 17 Years Later\n\nKingdom Hearts II is a 2005 action role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix in collaboration with Buena Vista Games for the PlayStation 2 video game console. The game is a sequel to Kingdom Hearts, and like the original game, combines characters and settings from Disney films with those of Square Enix's Final Fantasy series. An expanded re-release of the game featuring new and additional content, Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, was released exclusively in Japan in March 2007. The Final Mix version of the game was later remastered in high definition and released globally as a part of the Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix collection for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nKingdom Hearts II is the third game in the Kingdom Hearts series. It picks up one year after the events of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. Sora, the protagonist of the first two games, returns to search for his lost friends while battling the sinister Organization XIII, a group of antagonists previously introduced in Chain of Memories. Like the previous games, Kingdom Hearts II features a large cast of characters from Disney and Square Enix properties.\n\nWelcome to my Kingdom Hearts 2 Analysis! Kingdom Hearts 2 is one of the most popular action games and in this Kingdom Hearts 2 Analysis 17 Years Later, I'm going to be reviewing Kingdom Hearts 2 - 17 Years Later. There will be story spoilers in this Kingdom Hearts 2 Review for Kingdom Hearts 2 this is an in-depth Analysis of Kingdom Hearts 2. Kingdom Hearts 2 - 17 Years Later is just my own opinion on Kingdom Hearts 2. If you disagree with me, that's okay. This Kingdom Hearts 2 analysis is the start of my Kingdom Hearts 2 Retrospective. Kingdom Hearts 2 - 17 Years Later is the best video I've made. Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD & Kingdom Hearts 2.5 HD is the current best way to play the original KH2. The Kingdom Hearts HD Collection has a few graphical hiccups but KH2 HD is a massive improvement over the original Kingdom Hearts 2. While this KH2 review isn't a Kingdom Hearts 1.5 & Kingdom Hearts 2.5 review, it's the place to be if you want to see nam's compendium start his Kingdom Hearts retrospective. kingdom hearts 4 was just announced and the reveal of kingdom hearts 4 inspired me to make this kingdom hearts 2 analysis."

Gear up with the very best AMD GPU on the market! \nhttps://www.amd.com/best-gpu-on-the-market\nAll footage of PC gameplay captured for this documentary was done using an AMD Radeon 6900xt Halo Infinite Limited Edition GPU, and an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X processor - providing a flawless presentation as I replayed each and every game in the Halo franchise. You can learn more using the link I've provided. \n\nThis is a full history of the Halo franchise. From Bungie's roots building Sci-fi themed shooters in their Chicago offices, to 343 Industries' newly released Season 2 for Halo Infinite. \n\nCelebrate 20 years of one of the most iconic first person shooter series every created by learning how the series has evolved! Halo is a first person shooter series created by Jason Jones, Marcus Lehto, and a team of Bungie developers and published by Microsoft for their new Xbox console. The series got its start as a hybrid RTS game built from the mold of their fantasy RTS series, Myth - and evolved to completely dominate the video gaming scene with its rich storytelling, beautiful scenery, balanced gunplay mechanics, and its revolutionary multiplayer. Following the groundbreaking Halo: Combat Evolved, Bungie created several more entries to the series, including Halo 2, Halo 3, a standalone expansion called Halo 3 ODST, and a prequel entry called Halo Reach. \n\nAfter Bungie's departure from the franchise, Microsoft created 343industries to carry on its legacy, resulting in Halo 4, Halo 5, and most recently Halo Infinite. \n\nJoin me as I detail each and every game, breaking down their development history, storyline, gameplay features, visuals, and their critical reception, all backed with each game's original soundtrack. \n\n_______________________________\n\nFollow me on Twitter!

(I record all of my own footage and need to purchase several old games for the footage) \n\nThis video was a tough one. Halo is not a series I'm quite as familiar with as past documentaries I've put together. In fact, some of these games I had played for the first time when recording. But thanks to some great archival work done by Bungie and some exhaustive interviews conducted by the likes of \"VICE\", I was able to piece together a complete breakdown of this series' history from start to finish. There's also a few easter eggs sprinkled in for diehard fans to discover, including some special cameo appearances from Halo Content Creator: LateNightGaming! Now sit back, grab a drink, and enjoy the ENTIRE History of Halo!\n\nTable of Contents\n________________________ \n\n00:00 Intro\n03:09 Old Bungie (1990)\n11:07 HaloCE Development\n20:28 HaloCE (2001)\n31:57 HaloCE PC (2003)\n33:40 Halo 2 Development\n39:14 Halo 2 (2004)\n47:35 Halo 3 Development\n49:56 Halo 3 (2007)\n56:55 Halo Wars Development\n59:39 Halo Wars (2009)\n01:03:12 Halo Movie\n01:05:26 Halo 3 ODST Development\n01:08:01 Halo 3 ODST (2009)\n01:12:15 Halo Reach Development\n01:14:10 Halo Reach (2010)\n01:20:22 Halo Anniversary Development\n01:22:26 Halo Anniversary (2011)\n01:24:18 Halo 4 Development\n01:26:48 Halo 4 (2012)\n01:34:29 Halo MCC Development\n01:36:44 Halo Master Chief Collection (2014)\n01:39:07 Halo: Spartan Assault/Strike (2013-2015)\n01:41:28 Halo 5 Development\n01:42:54 Halo 5: Guardians (2015)\n01:48:55 Halo Wars 2 Development\n01:51:20 Halo Wars 2 (2017)\n01:56:10 Halo Infinite Development\n01:59:46 Halo Infinite (2021)\n02:06:55 Conclusion\n\n________________________ \n\nSpecial thanks to: \n\nEpicTrailerMusicUK - Listen to his full orchestral Halo cover here: https://youtu.be/CBsaS8gWwQI \n\nScifidan - for his help brainstorming a Title animation.

From there, Camelot Software Planning would be in charge of all Golf and Tennis games that would have Mario and company's appearance slapped all over them. However, Camelot would also create an original franchise where they retrace their roots with Japanese Role-Playing games, and that creation would be what all of us would know today as Golden Sun! In this video we delve into the history of this franchise with discussing each game released as well as Golden Sun's place in the video game industry along with what it, the Takahashi Brothers, and Camelot Software Planning must acknowledge if they want to continue on with this IP. For your pleasure, I present to you my retrospective of Golden Sun!\n\nPlease rate this video as well as leaving your feedback in the comments!\n\nHope you enjoy this episode and thanks for watching!\n\nAll characters, music, scenarios, and gameplay are owned by both Nintendo and Camelot Software Planning.\n\nThanks to The Nostalgic Gamer for the inspiration!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/NostalgicGamer86\n\nRRPG Game Riffers Solo Channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/RRPGGameRiffersSolo\n\nThe Game Riffers\nhttp://www.youtube.com/TheGameRiffers\n\nOriginal Epic Trailer created by Dimka4D\nEpic Trailer Music by AudioPizza\nEdits made by RRPGReviews\n\n#GoldenSun #Nintendo #Retrospective"

Seeing as how the past game maintained tradition to their themes and not hardly innovating or challenging the conventions to bring about newer things that could benefit Square and their fans, Hironobu Sakaguchi decided that the last Super Famicom entry would make sure that the 16-bit trilogy would end off with a bang by working as producer for the series from here on out. Final Fantasy VI still holds up really well, and RRPG is here to talk to you all about why this installment is very special. I present to you all with Episode 4 of RRPG's Final Fantasy Retrospective!

Not only was it a revolution toward JRPGs because of it being the first to jump into full-on 3D in the presentation, but it also brought about its own metaseries with other games, a movie, some original video animations, and a huge catalog of novellas to bring about so much lore into this entry. Final Fantasy VII was the first game to bring the franchise into the PlayStation era after unfortunate circumstances between Squaresoft and Nintendo started to get underway, but it could be seen as both a blessing by many and a curse by some. Whether anyone believes that Final Fantasy VII is the best in the series or the most overrated of the bunch; we can all agree that it was not only an amazing entry, but one of the best in the entire series next to its predecessors. In this episode, we will tackle both the original game and the entries that came out of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. I hope you enjoy as this is probably my best work to date, and the most fun I had putting this episode together!

Final Fantasy VIII is the next game to be envisioned from the team behind Final Fantasy VII as it went for a game with a more brighter atmosphere that had dark overtones in its overall delivery. While being considered probably one of the most polarizing entries in the PSOne's library much like Final Fantasy II on the Famicom, the eighth installment had its own merits where it becomes just as fun as most of the others. Final Fantasy IX, on the other hand, is lead by Hiroyuki Ito from Final Fantasy VI as he would bring the series back to its roots along with the help of the father of the franchise; Hironobu Sakaguchi. Being his love letter to long-time fans who felt the last two games have sidetracked what the franchise was supposed to mean, Sakaguchi-san delivers on his promise with bringing in his creativity on how he fully envisions the franchise he created during the days of the NES/Famicom & SNES/Super Famicom era for the franchise. Episode 6 of RRPG's Final Fantasy Retrospective is live, and I hope you all enjoy this one as it was just as much fun to put together as the last one.

In this episode, we take a look at the series, first outing on the PlayStation 2 and its sequel that would mark a turning point between Square's successful runs and incredulous hardships that were to be inbound for their future. For being the first game to break away from tradition with the setting being mostly that amongst Japan, Thailand, Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific while giving them an ancient and modern twist, Final Fantasy X and X-2 would be envisioned in the minds of those who lead the series' stronger, global appeal with Final Fantasy VII, and they consider this game to not only be the start of polymorphic content, but a prequel set in the same universe as the game that made them mark their place in gaming history.

Being derived as an evolution of MUDs that became popular in older computers during the 70s and 80s, that genre would evolve itself into Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games which Richard Garriott's own Ultima Online started that movement. After Sony Online Entertainment's own EverQuest came out and revolutionized the genre further by making it the first MMORPG to be in 3D, Final Fantasy XI would be conceived by taking inspirations from EverQuest while adding in the Final Fantasy series' own flavor to make it an important game in the history of role-playing games. What came about was more a divisive experience than mostly an overwhelmingly, positive experience as Final Fantasy XI would be followed by mostly a vocal minority. It would continue to be around for over 15 years as five expansions and seven add-on scenarios kept it alive for the game's most faithful to come back to the fictional world of Vana'diel on a daily basis. It is time that RRPG takes a look at Final Fantasy XI and everything that covers the game as Episode 8 of his Final Fantasy Retrospective is live! Enjoy as this episode was a truly arduous and challenging episode to put together!\n\nSpecial Thanks to the people of the GhostRiders Linkshell group in Final Fantasy XI who helped RRPG make this episode of his Final Fantasy Retrospective possible! Without your guidance, this episode would not be released.\n\nPlease rate this video as well as leaving your feedback in the comments!\n\nHope you enjoy this episode and thanks for watching!\n\n-UPDATE-\nSomeone pointed this out in the comments, but I wanted to make a clarification that I forgot to post in the video. Some of the features in the game when I was talking about Final Fantasy XI in its original state did not become available until much later on like Trusts and Adventuring Fellows of that matter. Again, I wanted to make a correction on that.\n\nThanks to The Nostalgic Gamer for the inspiration!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/NostalgicGamer86\n\nRRPG Game Riffers Solo Channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/RRPGGameRiffersSolo\n\nThe Game Riffers\nhttp://www.youtube.com/TheGameRiffers\n\nOriginal Heroic Opener Intro create by Epicdreamz\nEdits made by RRPGReviews\n\n#FinalFantasy #SquareEnix #Retrospective"

Starting off as a spin-off with Final Fantasy Tactics, Ivalice grew into something bigger as more games were being made that centered around that mythology; including what would eventually be conceived as the twelfth, mainline installment to the Final Fantasy franchise. However, it's existence would mark it as a polarizing entry where a vast majority love it while another vast majority would find it to be boring, but its success would lead it into a new media empire with games set in that world. We talk about those games while also exploring the details of a cancelled game set in that world, discover the actual chronology of Ivalice's timeline, and look back in retrospect with what Yasumi Matsuno and his creation managed to accomplish for Square Enix while also expressing what must be done for there to be more games based on that universe.

For being such an ambitious project with Final Fantasy XIII, its pair of sequels, and the many other games and novellas that came out for it, the multimedia franchise would be one of the most controversial things to ever come out of the company. Whether if it's because of Lightning's portrayal or the main cast of characters, its over-arching plot that became even more convoluted with every game that came out, or the need to making the game have a pair of sequels to become a trilogy, Fabula Nova Crystallis and Final Fantasy XIII has been a mixed bag between fans and the general public. RRPG goes over the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy as well as giving an honorable mention to Final Fantasy Type-0 that was worked on by Hajime Tabata!

Being originally conceived by the team who worked on Final Fantasy XI, what was to first arrive for Final Fantasy XIV would continue to attribute to terrible and tragic woes within the Japanese RPG company. However, a young man named Naoki Yoshida would be placed in charge with revitalizing the game into something completely different, and Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn would be the renaissance that the Final Fantasy IP desperately needed to revive Hironobu Sakaguchi's creation into a new and more, appropriate direction for the modern times. With a successful relaunch came three expansions, and they continue to build upon the previous one where the saga of Final Fantasy XIV remains an important and strong relic for video games and toward Square Enix's competitors! Why did it start off so bad, but successfully gain a second wind to push it as a major game in today's community and industry? Sit back, relax, and RRPG will tell you all about it. This is Episode 11 of RRPG's Final Fantasy Retrospective that covers the entirety of Final Fantasy XIV! Enjoy!\n\n-UPDATE-\nI didn't realize this until someone pointed out to me, but I got my information wrong when it came to the Au Ra being playable in A Realm Reborn. However, they appeared in Heavensward as a playable race and not in A Realm Reborn as I originally thought they were. Thanks to all of those who pointed that out! If I ever did a remaster of this video then I would make that correction!\n\n-DISCLAIMER-\n\nAll the footage in this episode of the retrospective only covers everything from the original Final Fantasy XIV all the way to Version 5.2 during Shadowbringers' current run, right now. Anything that comes out after that is not covered in this video, so I kindly ask you all to refrain from asking me about why I did not cover any future patches and content for this game because you will know exactly why. I may do a follow-up that covers more of this game in the future, but that is still up in the air. Anyway, I just wanted to clarify you all on that!

However, its size and scope grew out of proportion that it would force the Japanese RPG company to rebrand the game as the next, mainline entry to their flagship franchise. Passing the torch to the director of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Type-0; Hajime Tabata would restructure the game to become what we now know as Final Fantasy XV. Final Fantasy XV is widely known as the Final Fantasy game to have the longest development cycle after many others that came before it, and its delivery left a very, divisive reaction from fans and gamers throughout the world. It's release would mark another turning point for the company, but it would be based on both the right and wrong reasons for their future. Whether the game was actually an enjoyable experience or a prolonged misstep remains debatable, but it has become another important game to the franchise's history. For episode 12, we look at the origins of this game as it was originally known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII, it's transformation and impact in the gaming world, and viewing the reflections of the past with how the series has to evolve, going forward. Even without Hironobu Sakaguchi working on the series for quite a long time, his creative integrity and spiritual representation still drive the Final Fantasy IP to greater heights than it ever has. Episode 12 of RRPG's Final Fantasy Retrospective has officially arrived. See you for the next episode, and enjoy!\n\n-DISCLAIMER-\n\nFor those of you who are about to bring up that Final Fantasy XV also came out on the Google Stadia, I already knew about that.

        "description": "Here's Windii's Twitter. This video's existence is totally thanks to her.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/girlbossuran\n\nOne thing I left out of the video is the idea that there may have actually been more than the 7 Chaos Emeralds in the original lore. It explains how there are Emeralds on all these different islands, and kinda fixes that weird stuff in 3. But I don't necessarily buy it. SA1 establishes there only being 7, leading me to believe that was always the intention. I think the Emeralds being all over is just a product of them being iconic to the series and the writers not caring that much about continuity.\n\nSorry if I did not cover absolutely every detail of every single spinoff manual and obscure commercial and such. I wanted to focus primarily on things I believe can possibly be considered canon, as well as some of my own theories of how these things could be explained, if Sonic Team had any interest in creating a proper universe and canon. I'm only 1 man. This took forever to put together as is. I've got everything linked below. Go look it up yourself if you're curious. In retrospect, I suppose I could have touched on the beam Eggman uses in Sonic the Fighters to make monochrome clones of characters. Obviously it's just a thing for mirror matches. But it would kinda be a cool thing to see return as a boss in a Mania 2 or something wouldn't it?\n\nI know I said I would keep it to Classic stuff, but then put a little Adventure in there. That's because Adventure was meant to build off the story set up already in the previous games. As the games go on, things change a lot. But that game is early enough that I think we can look at a number of things in that, and assume it lines up with the original intentions of the Classic games.\n\nI know this may have come off a bit weaby with how much I was discrediting the localized material. But that's only because I do genuinely really like the original intended stories and concepts of these games, and so many people are unaware of them. Most people think of the far inferior, in my opinion, localized stories or cartoons and comics as how Sonic \"used to be\", when according to the creators, it never used to be like that at all.\n\nI was originally thinking of just making 1 video of me just turning on the mic for an hour and rambling about whatever came to mind across all Sonic stories and lore. But I quickly realized that I had far, far, FAAAAR too much to talk about. So instead I went insane and decided to try making a ridiculously big video to see how it goes.\n\nThe other videos talking about Sonic stories will be different. I only went in so much detail here because of how unknown this stuff is. In future, since the games can tell actual stories on their own, I will take a more analytical approach, looking at the writing and storytelling techniques. And it'll probably 1 or 2 games per video because of that. And nowhere near as long... I hope.\n\nThe Original Story document is something. It has some of the original, scrapped concepts for Sonic in it, as well as more finalized material. It's not 100% clear what can and cannot be considered canon, but a lot of it is corroborated by other material. But those original concepts are pretty out there. Glad they didn't go with any of that. The Sonic the Hedgehog Story Comic manga is also cool. You get to see what some of those later scrapped concepts might have looked like. You'll have to look that one up for yourself. Both are very interesting.\n\nIf I got anything wrong, left out details or anyone has their own interesting theories, please do leave a comment. I'd love to hear it. And if you want to read up on this stuff yourself, here is every resource I referenced for making this video.\n\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Original_Story\nhttps://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(16-bit)/Manuals\nhttps://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2_(16-bit)/Manuals\nhttps://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_3/Manuals\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_%26_Knuckles/Manuals\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_CD/Manuals\nhttps://info.sonicretro.org/Chaotix/Manuals\n\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(8-bit)/Manuals\nhttps://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2_(8-bit)/Manuals\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycpSsRKR1vY\nhttps://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Chaos/Manuals\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Spinball/Manuals\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Drift/Manuals\nhttps://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_Triple_Trouble/Manuals\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Drift_2/Manuals\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Tails%27_Skypatrol/Manuals\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Tails_Adventures/Manuals\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Labyrinth/Manuals\nhttps://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/bean-bark-fighers-megamix-profiles.37061/\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_3D:_Flickies%27_Island/Manuals\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_Blast/Manuals\nhttp://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_R/Manuals"

        "description": "A significant chunk of Sonic the Hedgehog's history has been brushed aside simply as \"the bad years,\" without much effort having gone into preserving the actual stories that led to Sonic's more controversial or perhaps disappointing titles: Games like Shadow the Hedgehog, Sonic Heroes, and to many, even Sonic Adventure 2.  Each of these Sonic games has a fascinating history that's been overshadowed by other discussions - each has its own story of crunch, of layoffs, of developers losing 20+ pounds trying to meet deadlines, of a Sega that was even closer to the brink than we ever remember.  \n\nRegardless of whether you feel that any of these Sonic titles ended up being good or bad, the chaos behind the scenes that led to these games explains essentially everything about them - and the stories are far worse than we tend to hear.  These are the true stories behind Sega's collapse, the fall of Sonic Team, and the \"dark era\" of Sonic games.\n\nSubscribe for more!  http://bit.ly/TGBSub\nSupport future videos!  http://www.patreon.com/TheGoldenBolt\nFollow me on Twitter!  http://www.twitter.com/TheGoldenBolt\nMugs, Merch, & More! http://bolt.merch.haus\nBecome a Channel Member! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIySeFc0rD9_WK5CRCuB_oA/join\n\n\n\"The Golden Bolt Theme\" composed by AllHailBuckets.

        "description": "A critique and analysis of the newest entry in to the long running Halo franchise...Halo Infinite. This review will primarily focus on the multiplayer component and delve in to topics such as base mechanics, map design, sandbox design, weapon balancing and tuning, player traits, custom game options, competitive features, casual features,  social features, the content on offer as well as the missing content not currently present such as forge and other game modes, 343's decision to utilize a free to play model (f2p) and much more. \n\n This commentary was created with the hopes of creating meaningful discussions within the Halo community and the gaming community at large. Most of the discussion has been dominated by the shortcomings within the item shop and in game store relating to the underwhelming customization system or the disappointing progression system. There have also of course been issues with cheating, hacking, and server issues such as desync. While all of those are important, and are mentioned here, I did want to give some attention to major issues that I believe need more attention and scrutiny. \n\n Gameplay is taken primarily of Halo Infinite with additional clips featuring Halo 3, Halo Reach, Halo 4, Halo 5, and some other misc. items. Halo is a First Person Shooter (FPS) and this gameplay features footage of all of its modes including Big Team Battle, Oddball, Slayer, and Capture the Flag (CTF). \n\n Halo Infinite is created by 343 Industries and published by Microsoft. It is available on Game Pass on PC and various Xbox platforms (Xbox One, Series X, Series S) \n\n A huge shoutout to FoxyDubz who edited this video for me and did a fantastic job. Please check out his channel here and show him some love : https://www.youtube.com/c/FoxyGrandpa410\n\n This commentary was concepted, written, and recorded by Favyn and he would greatly appreciate it if you'd like and subscribe for more content and to please join the discussion in the comments below. I encourage all conversations...especially from those who disagree with me and I read every comment I receive. So by all means rant away, I'd just ask that you keep it civil and treat everyone with respect. \n\n Thank you all for watching. Below you will find links to various videos that I mentioned here or that might provide further context to this project.\n\n My video Why Halo Struggles to Evolve which is the foundation for a lot of these concepts:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHUSlPq5Nag\n\n My full thoughts on Clamber:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfilAcimqcY&t=11s\n\n A video on Sprint which also outlines my thoughts on movement options and mobility mechanics coming in to this new title : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ1cAra_CrA&t=29s\n\n Some thoughts on Halo's Weapon Sandbox which might tie in to the discussion this video has about the Assault Rifle (AR) and Battle Rifle (BR): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfpkuMIGe0s\n\n Here are a couple videos from The Act Man who did a good job of outlining additional issues with Infinite's lack of content and custom game options: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARNBtGn70ww\n\n and this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i6WOceroyU\n\n\n Once again thank you all so much for watching...til next time!"

Nintendo’s first entries in the Super Mario Bros. series. These games are well past the 30 year mark, and yet people still love them just as much as they did on the day these games came out. As great as this set is, their legacy still stands thanks in part to a clever strategy by Nintendo. It was all done in a way that seems like a foregone conclusion these days, but way back when was unheard of, and actually quite genius. \nIt’s a tale as old as time. Your favorite video games get old. New ones come out, and those favorites of yesteryear fade away. This generational change has been happening for decades now. Over time, this changing of the tides has solidified into a precise schedule: every 5-6 years for Nintendo, and 8-10 years for everyone else! While it is a standard practice these days, back in the Early 90s, things weren’t as orderly as they are now.\nAs the 1990s began, Nintendo had 3 product lines! The 8-bit Family Computer, the portable GameBoy and the 16-bit Super Famicom.\n\nGenerational shifts had happened before. In Japan, Sega, and Epoch before then, simply axed the older machine, and made a clean break for the next generation. Nintendo did opposite and kept the 8-bit line alive, alongside 16-bit. For while, this worked well, as fans began to migrate. Eventually, hardware sales, software sales, and software TITLES of the Super Famicom surpassed the older Family Computer. As the Super Famicom came to West as the Super NES, the same pattern followed. The NES was phased out, newer games came much less frequently. The older titles would fall out of print. While newer games were promoted.\n\nDuring this changeover, new fans were coming along for the ride. A younger generation was coming up and entering gaming at 16-bit level. \nThat weird generational gap left Nintendo in a pinch! One on hand you had a new set of fans, who may have heard of Mario’s previous adventures, but without the older NES had no means to play them! Then you had all the old-timers who had nothing new to play! And if they wanted to take a trip through the “Groove Yard of Forgotten Hits” you had to dig out that old machine!  And deal with old, outdated, 8-bit graphics!\n\nIn 1993, Nintendo finally answered everyone’s prayers with a special compilation. Something new and exciting. Something that, at the time, had never been done before. Nintendo took their past Super Mario Bros. games, remastered them for the 16-bit era, and sold them in one package. Super Mario Collection! Known in the West as Super Mario All-Stars.\n\nNow everyone could enjoy all of Mario’s greatest hits, with improved graphics, sound, controls  and other niceties that weren’t possible on 8-bit!\n\nSome clips courtesy of Raven XP, NenRiki, Vinni 64 and Game Escape.\nMusic courtesy of Qumu and Akihabara Electric Circus."

Maybe gamers' standards have lowered to dramatically that any great game is now considered a masterpiece, but Elden Ring is way too flawed to be one.  Partly because it shares the same problems as Dark Souls 3, and partly because it chases modern gaming trends like giant Open Worlds with repetitive copy-pasted dungeons and bosses.

With that anniversary and the ongoing real-world pandemic, it seemed an incredibly appropriate time to dive back into this dark world of death and consequences.  Does the game hold up a decade later?  Are the moral choices presented to players just as knotty and fun to untangle as they were back then?

It’s horror as old as the genre itself, much like the vampire, the slasher, and the ghoul. But zombies have been seen in gaming far more than others in its field. Stubbs, Resident Evil, Left 4 Dead, Back for Blood, just to name a few. Now just because these games are part of an oversaturated subgenre does not mean that they are inferior to any competitors or lesser than a game in any other genre, but it’s important to establish just how many zombie games are out there. You wouldn’t be wrong to think that developers have probably done everything. I mean, gameplay-wise you are put in fight or flight scenarios and almost every game saw you fighting, and doing so with engaging mechanics. Those that saw you opting for flight due to lack of resources or ways to defeat your undead foe saw you high tailing it in the other direction with minimal depth, just running and maybe jumping a few places. It’s surprising then, that it wasn’t until 2015 that Techland developed Dying Light, a game that features fight or flight like many of its predecessors but puts extra focus on the latter, leading to a game that garnered mainstream success and a cult following years after. \n\nDying Light 7 Years Later. Dying Light is one of the most memorable zombie games I've ever played. In this Dying Light critique, we will be covering the game from top to bottom and this Dying light analysis will not include a dying light 2 review. If this dying light retrospective is received well then I would love to make a dying light 2 critique. This video can also satisfy anyone looking for a Dying Light story summary. Dying Light - 7 Years Later is still a masterpiece. dying light 2 and specifically dying light 2 gameplay have made me appreciate the first dying light and Dying Light The Following a lot more and I think you will see why when I get to the dying light the following review at the end of this video. I hope we see more dying light in 2022 outside of its sequel. Perhaps this year I will make a dying light stay human review which would compliment this dying light review and subsequently, the dying light ending explained. I talk a lot about the Dying Light Lore and I hope the Dying Light Lore Explained how great this game is from a world-building perspective."

You may not have heard of Berserk's games. They're not very popular. Kentaro Miura's masterpiece Berserk is a series near and dear to a lot of people, but I don't see the games mentioned much. Why is that? Well, you and me gonna find out. Let's take a step out of Limgrave, and a step into Midland for Sword of the Berserk Guts Rage, Berserk Millennium Falcon Arc Chapter of the Holy Demon War aka Berserk Ps2 and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk aka Berserk Musou.\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Chapter Select  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n0:00 - Intro\n4:24 - Sword of the Berserk: Guts Rage\n26:24 - Berserk Millennium Falcon Arc: Chapter of the Holy Demon War\n49:18 - Berserk and the Band of the Hawk\n1:16:43 - Outro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Berserk #BerserkGame #SwordOfTheBerserk #KentaroMiura #GutsRage #BerserkPs2 #BerserkGames #BerserkBandOfTheHawk #EldenRingBerserk"

        "description": "Developed by WB Montreal, Batman: Arkham Origins is a prequel game to the rest of the Arkham series, taking place 2 years into Bruce Wayne's career as Batman. When Black Mask puts a bounty on Batman's head, 8 of the worlds greatest assassins show up to Gotham for an attempt to kill the bat. This is the first time Batman has had to deal with enemies of this caliber, and it serves as his introduction to noteworthy villains like Bane, Deathstroke, Deadshot, and Joker.  It's often seen as the lesser of the 4 main Arkham games, but I think it deserves more credit than that. So in this video, I want to take a deep-dive into Batman: Arkham Origins and discuss everything it has to offer, as well as how it stacks up compared to the Rocksteady games. \n\nAlways Nerdy is a Youtube channel dedicated to all things nerdy, with a focus on comic book game retrospectives for both DC and Marvel.

The face of the playstation going toe to toe with titans like Master Chief and Mario, and the evolution from its original title of “Project: Big” to Uncharted was nothing short of magnificent. Ironically, this series that has, since its inception, been associated with the phrase “greatness from small beginnings” has been over the top from it’s first entry. The second Uncharted then came around and did everything the first game did right better, and any wrongdoings were corrected. While Uncharted 2 Drake's Fortune isn’t perfect, it gets respectfully close. A reasonable question to ask after receiving a sequel that topped its predecessor in every way is “How can they do it again?” How can Naughty Dog possibly make another game that not only improves upon its last installment but dwarf it in comparison? Perhaps Uncharted 3 is the answer. \n\nEdited by Playstayshaun\nShauns Twitter: https://twitter.com/PlaystayShaun_\nShauns YouTube Channel: https://youtube.com/c/PlaystayShaun\n\nBecome a Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thatboyaqua\n\nChannel Memberships: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwKY6YKl0-amtFsfYEDpMkA/join\n\nFollow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBoyAqua\n\nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/VBJwTUa\n\nOther Essays: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0hudNq_z8tDAoBj0iR1bO2f0U8TRQDu8\n\nUncharted: Drakes Fortune - 14 Years Later: https://youtu.be/3QObspL6N80\n\nUncharted 2: Among Thieves - 13 Years Later:\nhttps://youtu.be/HZA0KHghtkA\n\n- Chapters - \nPrologue: 0:00\nCh. 1: A Pure Blockbuster: 4:45 \nCh. 2: Third Time's A Charm: 8:23\nCh. 3: Deja Vu: 20:25\nCh. 4: A Strong Trilogy: 30:17\nEpilogue: 31:40\n\nUncharted 3: Drake's Deception is a 2011 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the third game in the Uncharted series, and was released in November 2011 for the PlayStation 3. The single-player story follows Nathan Drake, who partners with his mentor Victor Sullivan as they search for the legendary lost city of Iram of the Pillars, whilst competing with a mercenary group led by Sullivan's former employer, Katherine Marlowe.\n\nDevelopment for Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception began in 2010. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3 the other developed The Last of Us. Development was approached with incorporating locations distinct from the series' previous entries, with the team deciding on a desert and urban areas, while they drew inspiration for the plot from archaeologist T. E. Lawrence. Naughty Dog also aimed to upgrade the game's openness and realism, which was done through increasing the volume of motion capture and voice acting, as well as conducting field research for better visual environments and sounds. The development team also sought to improve the multiplayer system, which included new competitive and cooperative modes, while the game is also notable for being one of the first to carry the new online PlayStation Network Pass feature.\n\nUncharted 3: Drake's Deception received critical acclaim for its voice acting, graphics, writing, story, and cinematic quality. Some criticized its linearity and found it inferior to Uncharted 2. The game received Game of the Year accolades from numerous publications and award events, and was a commercial success, selling over six million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling PlayStation 3 games. The game was followed by a sequel titled Uncharted 4: A Thief's End in 2016, and was re-released on PlayStation 4 as part of Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection.\n\nuncharted 3,uncharted 3: drakes deception,uncharted 3 11 years later,uncharted 3 drakes deception 11 years later,uncharted 3 restorspective,uncharted restrspective,uncharted 3 analysis,uncharted 3 critique,uncharted 3 review,uncharted remastered,uncharted ps5,uncharted 3 story explained,uncharted critique,uncharted analysis,uncharted 3 ending explained,uncharted 3 gameplay,uncharted 3 secrets,that boy aqua, drakes deception 11 years later, uncharted"

        "description": "This is a series of reviews chronicling every individual boss fight in the Dark Souls series from Dark Souls 1, 2, and 3 including the DLC. It's a critical analysis examining their mechanics, move sets, and unique elements that separate them from others.\n\nThe gestures at the end of each review are a rating of sorts not meant to be taken fully seriously as it's difficult to sum up a complicated opinion with one gesture. Basically point forward roughly equals (decent), point down equals (mostly negative), and point up means (mostly positive), and then the others mostly speak for themselves.\n\nTimestamps:\nDark Souls: 5:32\nDark Souls 2: 36:30\nDark Souls 3: 1:31:54\n\nNotes- I'm sorry this video took so long to make. I had the most production problems I've ever had when making one of these videos including my AC going out twice, loosing my voice, having to re-edit half of the video because of my voice, and lots of real life issues causing me to have to delay production. I love doing these but this one nearly killed me."

        "description": "Holy moly this Dragons Dogma long form analysis/ retrospective/ gameplay/ talkthrough/ impressions/ commentary thing was loong overdue…\n\nSorry for the long wait but I sincerely hope this was worth the wait for you guys! This was a fun project although I think I stressed more than I should’ve. Real life has made it difficult to take time off to work on this so that is the reason why this is almost half a year in the making.. Also yes. It turned out to be a bit longer than one hour. I guess that + was bigger than anticipated lol. \n\nI know this is not quite a retrospective in the traditional sense, but I wanted to do something different. And after getting Private Sessions’ blessing to do this after seeing his Skyrim retrospective it kinda just snowballed into this mess. \n\nI have however been super lucky with friends that have helped me out during this project. My best man has watched through this vid several times to help me pick out and fix minor things and giving me ideas etc. Spoogie Derpington has also been super helpful during this time. So a huge shoutout to him as well. Thank you for being my therapist when I’ve needed to vent lol.\n\nAlso I know I’ve glossed over a lot of stuff in this vid. I just covered what I felt was most interesting and entertaining. Also the Bitterblack Isles was not even in my mind during this. I just wanted the “vanilla” game. Maybe Chad and BJ will return on a BBI adventure?\n\nI feel I should clarify why Quina has been captured by Grigori. The game has an “affinity” stat that governs how much npc’s like you. Giving Quina the Blessed flower raised her affinity to max and thus she is our “beloved” as Grigori calls it.\n\nAlso hope you guys like my new avatar and thumbnails.

        "description": "If you enjoyed this video, then please consider subscribing to my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/andystake. I hope you’ll also leave a like, a comment, and subscribe to the channel :) \n\nThank you so much to the incredible artist Emeraldus for letting me use her artwork as thumbnail for this video. You can find her other work right here:\nDeviantart: https://www.deviantart.com/emeraldus \nArtStation: https://www.artstation.com/emeraldus \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/emeraldus/?hl=nb \nEmeraldus Design: https://www.emeraldusdesign.com/\n\nThank you so much to kylelandry for making the perfect rendition of Suteki Da Ne which is not copyrighted claimed :) link to his video: https://youtu.be/FcR8KP7XSI0 \n\nFinal Fantasy X is the game which has impacted my life the most. As the game just turned 20, I felt it was the right time to pour my heart into a project which, I hope, has truly shown how amazing and unique I find it.  To put things into perspective, I ugly cried three times during the making of this video. First, after writing the script and watching the ending unfold. Second, when I had finished putting the video on top of the audio, forced to watch Tidus’ and Yuna’s last moments together again. And third, when I watched the entire video in one setting to iron out the quirks, and the beautiful sights and sounds of Spira came together one last time. \n\nFinal Fantasy X is so special to me because it managed to make me feel things, to such a degree, no other game has done before or really after it. The characters, the story, the music, the voice acting, the pacing, everything comes so perfectly together here, and Square-Enix has never managed to make something as perfect ever since. Not even close.\nThis video is first and foremost meant as a tribute to the game, taking you through the entire story and plot of Final Fantasy X, accompanied by my own thoughts and comments on a myriad of aspects, ranging from the plot to gameplay mechanics. I have decided to ultimately focus predominantly on the story, as that is what, to me, truly sets this game apart from the rest. I have also made the artistic decision to include many longer scenes from the game, some which are several minutes long, so as to best convey the original intent and feeling of the game, but shortening them where it makes sense. I hope my choices have made sense to you, and if not, I hope you’ll let me know in the comments. \n\nI have also to the best of my ability included the game’s soundtracks where they fit best, so as to the highest degree possible convey the feeling of being in each section and area of the game. I hope you enjoy my dedication to the game. If you feel like I have left anything out, or if you have any interesting things to add to the story or characters or the world itself, then please let me know – I’d love to hear it.\n\nThis project has taken me an entire month to put together and release in the state in which it is presented, which is the main reason why I have been unable to produce as many videos as quickly as I have in the previous months. It was hard, but I am ultimately extremely proud of it. It could not have been accomplished however, without the help of YouTubers Krow’s Graveyard and Sharriko, both of whom have made extensive “no commentary” walkthroughs of the game, the former on PlayStation 2, and the latter on PS4 and PC. I am in their debt, and cannot thank them enough.   I have used an excellent piano cover by YouTuber Kylelandry during the Macalania kissing scene and for my end credits, so thank you very much to all of these YouTubers, and please make sure to check out their channels. \n\nLastly, a massive thank you to the developers, writers, voice actors and composers of Squaresoft, who managed to create a masterpiece for the ages. Thank you. \n\nAnd to you - thank you so much for watching the video. I sincerely hope I’ve managed to create something which you enjoyed watching as much as I enjoyed making. \n\nUntil next time. Cheers, friend.\n\n- Andy\n\n#FinalFantasyX\n#FinalFantasyXUltimateAnalysis\n#FinalFantasyXRetrospective\n#FinalFantasyXReview\n#FFXReview\n#FFXFullGame\n#FinalFantasyXFullStory\n#FinalFantasyXStoryAnalysis\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n03:50 - Zanarkand\n10:35 - Baaj Temple/Underwater Ruins\n15:04 - Besaid Island \n42:42 - Kilika \n50:49 - S.S Winno\n58:15 - Luca \n1:20:30 - Mihen Highroad\n1:35:04 - Mushroom Rock Road \n1:50:22 - Djose Temple\n1:55:54 - The Moonflow \n2:06:08 - Guadosalam/Farplane\n2:18:28 - Thunder Planes\n2:23:54 - Macalania Woods \n2:30:30 - Macalania Temple\n2:41:14 - Bikanel Desert/Home\n2:48:52 - Airship\n2:53:33 - Bevelle/Wedding/Trial\n3:07:16 - Macalania Woods/Kissing Scene\n3:13:50 - The Calm Lands \n3:16:20 - Mount Gagazet/Revelation\n3:30:28 - Zanarkand Ruins \n3:56:10 - Return to Airship \n4:04:04 - Sin Airship Battles\n4:07:37 - Sin/Final Scenes\n4:24:33 - Outro"

        "description": "The Making of Tomb Raider is a retrospective documentary on the development of the PS1 classic, the original Tomb Raider from 1996.  Join us as we go behind the scenes of Lara Croft's first adventure, and review the creation of a classic with Tomb Raider 1.\nThe late 90's would see an explosion of games utilizing 3D rendered graphics, an event that would change the landscape of video games forever. One such game was the original Tomb Raider. An ambitious project put together by a team of only six core developers; Tomb Raider would become a landmark for the genre of third person action games. In this episode I take an extensive look into the development of Tomb Raider 1. This video is compiled together from a litany of different quotes, clips, and sources, in an attempt to tell the story of the development team that started one of the biggest franchises in gaming.\n\n#TombRaider #retrospective #PS1 #games #review #Documentary\n\nThis video is the Second part in a series of analysis videos on games called Pixel to Polygon. I will continue to make videos for the series into the future.\n\nI would like to thank all the friends and family who offered me encouragement and support while I finished this project. It was a long and tough one and you really helped me to get it done.\n\nA special thank you to my friend Mike for processing the voice over audio for me.

The total footage of BDSP I downloaded from my Twitch series to use in this review is 60.67GB of footage, along with 11.9GB of footage I used from my Platinum series.  Combined with all the other game footage, and footage I needed to use from other channels, I have no doubt this project easily passed 100GB of material I gathered for use, and it certainly took a toll on my computer.  My video editing software crashed several times, my computer as a whole even crashed once after everything went red and it was like \"oops your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart\".  It was a miracle my computer could handle this project at all, and I had to break it into four separate projects to diminish lag and crashes.\nI worked on the earlier Chapters during my playthrough, as those didn't need the game beaten to create, and worked on the script for the other chapters as the playthrough went on.  I would complete the video of a chapter, finish the script for the next one, make it into a complete video, finish the script of the next one, and so on, that was my work loop.  Sometimes I'd work on script on the side while listening to online lectures, or some nights if I couldn't sleep I'd pull up my phone and type up more script.  Chapters 1-2 I had completed before the holidays, but between the holidays and new year I'd be away.  So I recorded the completed script for Chapter 3, and left my desktop on to remote in.  Dec 26 - 31 was just a full-time week completing the gameplay chapter off of my old laptop remoting into my desktop at home, even recorded the Platinum TM footage I needed remotely if anybody caught that clip with an empty chair as I was on the other side of the province at the time.  Then January 2022 was about committing to completing the script and video for Chapters 4-7.  And so, here we are today.  I was honestly REALLY worried about being able to finish this video essay before Legends Arceus released, thank goodness it worked out...\n(Also yes I stole the Dawn art I drew on this thumbnail from my Opinions on Video Games thumbnail and changed the thumbnail of that video to something else)\nI think I need to take a break from video essays for a while now, or maybe start doing some more short form essays...\n\n📖Legend\n_____________________\n0:00       Introduction\n1:39       Chapter 1 - Pokémon's Remake History, Before Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl's Release\n23:23     Chapter 2 - The Hidden Scheme\n36:46     Chapter 3 - Gameplay\n1:24:47  Chapter 4 - Visuals & Aesthetics\n1:39:38  Chapter 5 - Soundtrack\n1:54:07  Chapter 6 - Story\n2:06:24  Chapter 7 - Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl\n_____________________\n\n⛰️Pokémon Legends Arceus Essay - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lM65W0eR1yU\n📋How Pokémon Lost Its Magic Essay - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njZSYPwGWRA\n📝Video Essays - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQtuKItcZ24oucfqUxGEAQViHHjiOPM2B\n\n🌌Pokémon Brilliant Diamond Playthrough - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQtuKItcZ24r2Qcd3BqYi1QyNE0mxY9nd\n⛰️Pokémon Legends Arceus Playthrough - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQtuKItcZ24rAvEwZgW-P1WSkyUUwTZ53\n🌌Pokémon Platinum Playthrough - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQtuKItcZ24qabMSySg4ulIe9jD6wvlKe\n🎼All Playthroughs - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvzTK_dCNePpGQ6KsQ2r6GA/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2&view_as=subscriber\n\n🎵Music & 📋Footage Credit\nThis will be in the pinned comment as the music credit alone and footage credit alone are each close to the YouTube description character limit, be sure to check out some of those talented remixers who make incredible music!\n\n⭐️Become a member of the channel to obtain a unique role in the Discord server, as well as have badges displayed by your name in comments and have unique emotes during the YouTube livestreams!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvzTK_dCNePpGQ6KsQ2r6GA/join\n\n🎥 Twitch - https://www.twitch.tv/acousticharmonia\n🌐 Discord - https://discord.gg/G335hnJ\n🐦 Twitter - https://twitter.com/AcoustcHarmonia\n🎼 Playthroughs - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvzTK_dCNePpGQ6KsQ2r6GA/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2&view_as=subscriber\n#PokemonBrilliantDiamond #PokemonShiningPearl #PokemonBDSP\n\nGame: Pokémon Brilliant Diamond\nPlatform: Nintendo Switch\nReleased: November 19, 2021\nDeveloper: ILCA\nPublishers: The Pokémon Company, Nintendo"

        "description": "You know, there was a pretty long period of time in my younger years where I held the opinion that Uncharted 2: Among Thieves was the greatest game ever made. And think about that, there were so many incredible games that came out in the years prior and in the same year, and yet I was convinced that Uncharted 2 was the best, and I wasn’t the only one who thought this and some even held this opinion for years after as Among Thieves has a reputation of being the greatest Uncharted game out of the entire series. But why? Are those people correct? Well, it’s been a significant amount of time since I revisited Uncharted 2 and for those who are new here, I have already covered the first Uncharted in a different video and I recommend you watch that video first. For those who just want the coles notes, I essentially really enjoyed Uncharted one even if it didn’t age very well at all. It held up nicely considering its 2007 release and It’s a fun game with a solid gameplay loop and while there are plot holes, gimmicks that overstay their welcome, and graphics that wear its age on its sleeve, It’s still worth playing if you are an Uncharted fan for experiencing the series roots, if not for the nostalgia. \n\nEdited by Playstayshaun\nShauns Twitter: https://twitter.com/PlaystayShaun_\nShauns YouTube Channel: https://youtube.com/c/PlaystayShaun\n\nBecome a Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thatboyaqua\n\nChannel Memberships: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwKY6YKl0-amtFsfYEDpMkA/join\n\nFollow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBoyAqua\n\nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/VBJwTUa\n\nOther Essays: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0hudNq_z8tDAoBj0iR1bO2f0U8TRQDu8\n\nUncharted: Drakes Fortune - 14 Years Later: https://youtu.be/3QObspL6N80\n\n- Chapters - \nPrologue: 0:00\nCh. 1: Same Paint, DIfferent Finish: 3:07\nCh. 2: Small Changes, Big Difference: 8:01\nCh. 3: Deja Vu: 25:16\nCh. 4: A Worthy Sequel: 35:36\nEpilogue: 37:55\n\nFirst revealed by Game Informer in December 2008, the first teaser trailer showed a weary, wounded Nathan Drake marching through a snowstorm to reach a phurba half-buried in the snow. Lead character artist Richard Diamant remarked that the trailer was rendered in real-time, using the game's engine. A second teaser trailer was released soon after, showing a badly wounded Drake stuck in the remains of a wrecked train hanging precariously over a cliff. The story begins in medias res with this opening. The narrative opens with a quote attributed to Marco Polo: \"I did not tell half of what I saw, for I knew I would not be believed\".\n\nThe game had three main writers: head writer Amy Hennig, Neil Druckmann and Josh Scherr.\n\nUncharted 2 features an online multiplayer component; Naughty Dog hired a dedicated multiplayer designer in August 2008 to work on this aspect of the game. The beta phase of the multiplayer was playable by those who bought early copies of the game inFamous. The beta was also accessible by annual subscribers of the PlayStation Network service, Qore, on June 3, to those who had subscribed to Qore by May 15. The beta codes from Qore began to be sent out on May 8, 2009. Beta codes from inFamous shipped inside the game's packaging, on May 26. In September 15, another beta was released and an open beta was released to the EU and US on September 29 via the PSN store. Both expired on October 12. In the first year since the game's launch, more than 125 million matches and 10,500 man-years had been played online.\n\nUncharted 2: Among Thieves received universal acclaim, being praised as one of the best video games of all time, and earning numerous \"Game of the Year\" awards, including Spike's Video Game Awards. The game got 41 perfect review scores, receiving a Metacritic score of 96 out of 100, making it the most critically acclaimed game of 2009.\n\nWelcome to Uncharted 2, or more accuratley, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. In this Uncharted 2 Among Thieves video we will be looking at Uncharted 2 13 years Later. Uncharted 2 Among Thieves 13 Years Later will go over my extended thoughts and this Uncharted 2 retrospective is the second part of my Uncharted restrspective. This Uncharted 2 Analysis and Uncharted 2 Critique is a bit more in depth than an IGN Uncharted 2 Review. I will be revisiting the Uncharted games until eventually the entire Uncharted remastered series is out. Until the Uncharted PS5 remaster is out, we will look at the Uncharted 2 story explained. If you have not seen my Uncharted critique and Uncharted analysis. This video can serve as a Uncharted 2 ending explained which does feature Uncharted 2 gameplay and a handful of Uncharted 2 secrets.

Nick tackles the entire Thief series, all four games, full of stealth gameplay and evasive action. That’s Thief: The Dark Project, Thief 2: The Metal Age, Thief: Deadly Shadows and Thief, the 2014 reboot. Enjoy this epic new eleventh Nth Review!\n\nAlso, there were about a dozen more blackjacks I couldn’t fit in because I’d already set the markers in Premiere and you couldn’t mass-move them. You’ll know what I’m talking about.\n\nNOTE: Nearly all the footage I used in this video for Thief: Deadly Shadows has been brightness/contrast corrected. It might look garish at times, but I had no idea how much darker the game was until I started editing it alongside everything else and it was borderline unusable until I started altering the footage. Hopefully it's not too annoying!\n\nI'mma... gonna take a short break for a minute.\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/F7qBusT\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/NthReview/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/NthReview\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/NthReview\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/TheNthReview\n\nAmazing Vaporwave/Hypnowave by Pitfall.\n(https://soundcloud.com/pitfall-3)\n\n@Ars Technica - War Stories on Thief w/ Paul Neurath https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzD9ldLoc3c\n@Grim Beard - Thief: The Dark Project\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqNE0nQMZ64\nJoseph Anderson - Why Horror Games Don’t Scare Me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_RBaEUstPI\nTTLG thread with conversation transcriptions\nhttps://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=71268&page=2\nGarage Games thread talking about generation of stealth volumes: http://www.garagegames.com/community/forums/viewthread/28039\nThief: Postmortem by lead programmer Tom Leonard: https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3355/postmortem_thief_the_dark_project.php?print=1\nAhead of its time: The History of Looking Glass (Polygon, Mike Mahardy)\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2015/4/6/8285529/looking-glass-history\nThief: Troubled Development\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2013/4/26/4269912/thief-reboot-impeded-by-office-politics-high-level-departures\nThe Dark Mod Fan-Made Thief\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brJqHnXmpgE\nThievery Mod trailer\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaevXgBfjy0\nThe modern day Thief reboot that never was (Thief 4: The Dagger of Ways)\nhttps://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-08-31-the-modern-day-thief-reboot-that-never-was\nPenny Arcade: They Are Genuinely Interested\nhttps://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/04/16\nNoclip - The Untold History of Arkane: Dishonored / Prey / Ravenholm / LMNO / The Crossing\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4kdqwdbZZ\nReport: Thief 4 Development in Trouble\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2012-06-14-report-thief-4-development-in-trouble.html\nFleshEatingZipper - Games Journalism is Bullshit and Other Secrets You Didn’t Know\nhttp://www.flesheatingzipper.com/gaming/2013/06/e3-2013-reveals-gaming-journalism-is-bullshit-and-other-secrets-you-didnt-know/\n\nMW2 footage - @L-1011 Widebody \nSilent Service gameplay - @Kelsey Polnik\nGauntlet Arcade gameplay - @AmitDabydeen \nDescent gameplay - @Kaizen Kitsune\nGoldeneye gameplay - @3iikka \nSkyrim lockpick gameplay - @NimsTV \nSplinter Cell lockpick gameplay - @AFGuidesHD \nCondemned: Criminal Origins gameplay - @VergilHilts \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:41 1.

The game takes place after the events of the movie and follows Ghost Rider as he attempts to stop the demons of Hell from taking over the world. Not only do you get to play as Ghost Rider in the game, but you can also unlock Blade as a fully playable character. However, since this was a movie tie-in game, it rushed to meet the deadline of the films release, which hindered some of it's creativity. So in this video, we'll analyze how the game was made, walk through the story, and discuss the best and worst parts of Ghost Rider the game.

It was the first to introduce webs that attach to buildings, and it included an open world New York City for you to explore. Although this is pretty standard nowadays, it was a pretty big deal back in 2004. It also features the voices of the movies cast, including Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Alfred Molina. It's considered to be one of the best superhero games every made and is highly regarded amongst fans.

However, this game would see a ton of improvements over the PS1 era Spider-Man games, including new combo attacks, aerial combat, and a playable Green Goblin! It even had some stars of the movie return to voice their characters. Specifically, Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe. Even though Spider-Man 1 felt like quite an improvement over prior games at the time, it's been overshadowed by the many Spider-Man games that came after it. So today, I hope you'll join me in revisiting the Spider-Man 1 movie game to discuss everything it did well, and why its been forgotten over time.\n\nAlways Nerdy is a Youtube channel dedicated to all things nerdy and Marvel, with a focus on Marvel Gaming properties such as Marvel's Avengers and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance series.

        "description": "The Punisher (2005) sees Frank Castle as he continues to clean up the streets of New York City in the most brutal way possible. The development team \"Volition Inc.\" leaned into the Punishers violent tendencies by putting you in the shoes of Frank Castle, allowing you to interrogate and kill criminals in unique ways. The Punisher is seen as an incredibly violent game, to the point it almost had a limited release, but it also has a lot of creativity. Garth Ennis & Jimmy Palmiotti took their experience writing Punisher comics and helped to pen the narrative of the Punisher game, providing an original story that ties to the 2004 movie in very minimal ways. We even get a lot of references to the wider marvel universe, with appearances from characters like Iron Man, Black Widow, and plenty more! In this video, we'll explore every angle of the Punisher game and discuss how it was made, where it excels, where it struggles, and ultimately how it holds up today. \n\nAlways Nerdy is a Youtube channel dedicated to all things nerdy and Marvel, with a focus on Marvel Gaming properties such as Marvel's Avengers and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance series.

        "description": "Today we are stepping away from the usual Final Fantasy content and will be looking at the very first game from the Kingdom Hearts franchise to start what will be a new series full of analysis and critiques.\n\nLet's look at Kingdom Hearts 20 years after it's original release and see what the game has to offer and if it's still as good as we think.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n3:57 Story (Basics)\n8:10 Gameplay\n19:03 Main Scenario Deep Dive\n26:58 Showing It's Age\n29:20 Soundtrack\n31:00 Post Story Content\n33:18 Conclusion\n35:34 Post Talk/Thank You \n\nThe Kingdom Hearts franchise is one that is well known and recognised around the world, even if you’re not a JRPG player the chances are at some point you’ve seen something about these games.\n\nWhat started off as a crazy collaboration between Square Enix and Disney has turned into something no one could have imagined with multiple numbered entries,\nMultiple Non numbered entries, re-releases on the ps3, concerts, a mobile game, re-releases on the ps4, a rhythm game, a movie about a box, and memes...a lot of memes.\n\nYou get the idea, what started off pretty wild is now just out of control, but don’t worry Nomura knows what he’s doing.\n\nDespite all the memes and criticism these games receive nowadays I’m always proud to say this franchise means a lot to me on a personal level and I truly find it to be one of a kind.\n\nYou can find an endless amount of discussions about how crazy and silly the plot of these games is at this point,\nBut what’s sad is that there is way more of these discussions than actually looking at what the games have to offer for the player individually. \n\nThe Kingdom Hearts bubble is pretty massive with 10 games available to be experienced on current consoles, although it should be pointed out 2 of those are movies and one is a demo. \nThat said it’s still a whole lot of content to get through.\n\nSo a few months back I announced that my next big project will be to go through the entire playable franchise, and I repeat the key word is “playable” so unfortunately no 358/2 days or Re:coded.\nBut even without those 2 projects I have got a fair amount to get through here, 7 full length games as well as one short experience in 0.2 birth by sleep, this is far from something I can get done in a couple months.\n\nAs I go through these games the aim will be to not just finish the main story but everything they have to offer, meaning collectables, secret bosses and yes I did claim to try and 100% the trophies along the way which I do still plan on doing but I might have leave some of these Platinum trophies for after I’ve completed the critiques, I’m looking at you Birth By Sleep.\n\nHowever I don’t want to get too far ahead of myself because in todays video we will start at the very beginning, back when the name kingdom hearts was a single game not a franchise and there was no 1.5 + 2.5 ReMix added at the end.\nForget the idea of all these other games and focus on just the one, what does the original Kingdom Hearts have to offer to you, the player. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, a like and comment would be much appreciated to help the channel,\nIf you're interested in more future content why not subscribe?\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nDescription Tags: Kingdom Hearts, kingdom hearts review, kingdom hearts retrospective, kingdom hearts critique, kingdom hearts 2022, kingdom hearts ps5, kingdom hearts 1.5, kingdom hearts analysis, JRPG,kingdom hearts 20th anniversary \n\n#KingdomHearts #KingdomHeartsReview #SquareEnix"

After all this time, I can't decide if this is one of the best or one of the worst reviews I've ever done. I guess you'll be the judge of that seeing as I know very little about this series and as such probably have no bloody idea what I'm talking about. But hey, did this non fan get converted to the blue side or did this game go fast right into a brick wall. In a video that as of right now might be one of my longest original release videos, get ready for a whole lotta trash talk, praise and everything in between. Also, no I refuse to do the \"Forces\" joke.

This time it's shorter and more concise than the last one. But it's not less analytical and in depth.

But in any case, I can finally scratch another remake off my bucket list and now the definitive TGX Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves review is up and I can rest, unless there happens to be anothe game in the series after Sly 3, which I'm going on record as saying that's a load of BS. So is Sly 3 the best or the worst game i the series?

I hear what you're saying. \"BrandoSP, you promised the Final Fantasy XIII-2 video was gonna be way shorter than the Final Fantasy XIII one\". Yeah, I know, I did. Similarly to how I didn't expect to be able to talk a full hour about FFXIII, I didn't expect FFXIII-2 was gonna get the same treatment. I have no regrets.\n\nIt used to be rare that a Final Fantasy game got a sequel. X-2 could have been an outlier. Suddenly, sequels in the Final Fantasy Series were becoming the norm. This gave them ample opportunity to have XIII-2 improve on XIII's mistakes. So did they? Well I happen to know just the video you should watch if you want to find out (Hint, it's this one). No Final Fantasy VII Remake influence in this one, at least in comparison to XIII, but there are some other development horror stories to tackle here. Hope ya stick around. \n\nThe Tweets at:  https://twitter.com/SpBrando\n\nThe First Video at:  https://youtu.be/Y0kw7CorRrc\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Chapter Select  ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:06 - So what is Final Fantasy XIII-2 + QTE Woes\n10:57 - Gameplay\n21:13 - The Monster System\n26:18 - Visuals & Music\n32:24 - Characters Both Old and New\n39:35 - A \"Unique\" Structure\n49:44 - Story Spoilers\n57:36 - I Can't Believe It's DLC\n59:32 - The 2nd Thrilling Conclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#FinalFantasyXIII2 #FinalFantasy132 #FinalFantasyXIII2Review #FinalFantasyXIII2Retrospective #FinalFantasyXIII2Gameplay #FinalFantasyXIII2Cutscene #FF132 #FF132Retrospective"

All I know is the channel's in a downswing, it's christmas, and persona's the only thing getting consistent viewership. So here's the supercut, because some people like long videos.\n\nThis series was brutal. Not bad, they're all playable to a point - just time consuming. When I look at other jrpg series, they seem impossible to cover purely by length of time required. It's a one (occasionally 2) person show, and it's hard enough recording full series. I already dislike having one franchise or series linger too long on my channel, I like engaging with new material frequently. \n\nSorry it dragged out so long, or that I didn't drip-feed it, or whatever, I just wanted to get my work-mountain done. Good learning experience anyway, provided it doesn't cost me the channel lol. Hoping for the best next year - I've got a great lineup.\n\nHere's my latest video: https://youtu.be/tGvJ94cUdzw\n\nIf you wanna support the channel you know where to find me, bless you for reading this far.\n\n0:00 Persona 1 + 2\n27:33 Persona 3 (FES)\n1:09:07 Persona 4 (Golden)\n1:56:58 Persona 5 (Royal)\n\n#persona #retrospective #kbash #supercut"

The miracles. The walking on water. The feeding of the 5000. The crucifixion. The video games. I didn’t know this. I also didn’t know there were SO MANY OF THEM. SO many Jesus games. PC Jesus video games are absolutely abundant, especially on Steam - and ever since the surprise hilarious reveal of I Am Jesus Christ trailer with a small snippet of I Am Jesus Christ gameplay (you get to fight SATAN IN IT), it inspired me to take a look back and see if anything else was made. As it turns out, it’s a lot. Get ready to be shocked and horrified as we look at Jesus in the Matrix gameplay with Jesus in the Matrix review, Five Loaves and 2 Fishes gameplay, Galilee Spectrum gameplay, yes there are even text adventure games based on religion as far back as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum games, Jesus in Space gameplay, JESUS famicom gameplay that was also JESUS NES gameplay and I managed to get my hand on JESUS MSX2 gameplay, with the MSX2 being the most popular Japanese home computer for original Metal Gear 1, Run Jesus Run gameplay that lasts less than 10 seconds, Jesus Christ RPG review with Jesus Christ RPG PC gameplay, yes, there is an RPG trilogy about Jesus Christ RPG Steam for FREE including a Jesus Christ RPG soundtrack, Fight of Gods PC gameplay with a Fight of Gods review, in fact will Fight of Gods ever come to Xbox or PS5? You can play as Jesus and fight Moses or Santa - so it’s basically South Park Jesus vs Santa but in real life! Save Jesus gameplay with Save Jesus review on PC or Steam, Fist of Jesus PC gameplay even though it’s actually Fist of Jesus Android gameplay with Fist of Jesus review since Fist of Jesus Steam doesn’t exist anymore, Pathway to Jesus iPhone gameplay, Miracles of Jesus PC game gameplay, The You Testament gameplay by MDickie who has a tonne of infamously bad MDickie games for PC, Secrets of Jesus gameplay for Steam with Secrets of Jesus review, and probably my favorite titled one - Fluffy and God’s Amazing Christmas Adventure gameplay. Yes, Fluffy is Jesus’ nickname. I promise. Get ready to watch Caddy leap into action in his cheapest Jesus costume, shouting from car park rooftops, jumping on village brick walls, bouncing on playground see saws, throwing full size toilets and even jumping off of a roof. Caddy jumps off a roof. Yes. You’re gonna want to see this Caddicarus Christmas Special. Happy Holidays, and I hope you enjoy the Caddicarus 2021 season closer - the Caddicarus 2021 Christmas Special.

We've covered the seminal Shadow of Chernobyl, the experimental Clear Sky and now the (at this time) Call of Pripyat. Each entry in this unknown gaming dynasty has brought something amazing to the table and I'm stoked to talk about how this carries on that tradition.

Final Fantasy XIII is definitely on the top of a \"Top 10 controversial Final Fantasy Games\" list, and I think it's time to establish two key things. (ALSO since this video is adjective + long, I'm using the YouTube chapter thing for the first time. Give it a try!) Also is it Final Fantasy XIII? Or Final Fantasy 13? Roman numerals? IDK. FF13, lets go with that\n\nThe first thing we gotta know is, was FFXIII as bad as everyone says it is? The second, is does Final Fantasy XIII deserve another chance? We've come a long way since it's release on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2009, we have iPhone's now! Did we have them back then? I could Google it but I won't. \n\nMaybe you've never heard of Final Fantasy XIII before, well buddy, do I have the video for you (Spoilers: It's this one). Whatever background you have with the Final Fantasy Series, allow this massive video to be your complete guide through The First Final Fantasy XIII game. Why is Final Fantasy VII Remake in the corner down there? Let's just say a shadow was being lived in.

Learn about the second trilogy from cyberpunk author William Gibson: Virtual Light, Idoru and All Tomorrow’s Parties, and discover the brilliant satire and criticism of modern America in Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash.\n\nJack in to cyberspace with the origins of hacker culture, its impact on us during the advent of the internet, and how that informed our worldview of the information superhighway, and films such as The Net, Hackers and Johnny Mnemonic. What inspired us to invest so much into virtual reality, from the Virtual Boy, to injecting VR cameos into movies and shows like Serial Experiments Lain, Wild Palms, The Lawnmower Man, and others? And how did monumental video games such as System Shock, System Shock 2 and Bioforge influence us as players?\n\nFor the send-off, how did philosophy and existentialism surmount in such treasures as Philip K. Dick's novels and research, eXistenZ, Dark City, The Thirteenth Floor, and most notably of all, The Matrix?

        "description": "After years of avoiding Assassin’s Creed Origins and after years of putting it off I finally got around to it and my god, do I feel strongly about it. I often listen to what you guys and gals in the comments say and based on your words, I was going into this game expecting it to blow me away as you had all stated it was by far the best in the new trilogy. Well, not ALL of you but a majority of you got my hopes up and as it turns out, I am head over heels for this game. Everything about it from the combat, stealth, exploration, the architecture of Egypt, the mythos of Egypt, and Bayeks story all were so much fun that I ruined my sleep schedule purely due to the absurd number of times I said, “I should really go to bed... gah let me just do one more thing”. I think it goes without saying but I believe this game is MILES ahead of Odyssey and Kilometres ahead of Valhalla. The entire time I played I was having so much fun and yet, by the end of the 25-hour campaign, I felt this wave of sadness wash over me. I came to this realization of why this game was so good for me, and more unfortunately why it was so good for a lot of other people. I realize that the reasons I love this game don’t necessarily line up with what everyone else likely loved about it.\n\nReddit Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/7fgwqy/origins_spoiler_ac_simulation_theory_ancient/\n\nBecome a Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thatboyaqua\n\nChannel Memberships: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwKY6YKl0-amtFsfYEDpMkA/join\n\nFollow my Twitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBoyAqua\n\nJoin the Discord: https://discord.gg/VBJwTUa\n\nOther Essays: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0hudNq_z8tDAoBj0iR1bO2f0U8TRQDu8\n\n- MUSIC IN ORDER - \n\nBillet Doux - Casiio\nEgyptians 3 - The Settlers 3\nA Day In Agrabah - Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5\nSlaysenflite - Age of Mythology\nDusty Dune Galaxy - Super Mario Galaxy\nTomb Time - Crash 3\nApproaching The Ruins - Ori and The Blind Forest\nEgyptians 1 - The Settlers 3\nThe Days When My Mother Was There - Persona 5\nDozing Sand Secret - Mario & Luigi Dream Team\nIn a Pile of its Own Good - Age of Mythology\nMaster of Stealth - Assassin’s Creed Origins\nBirth of the Creed - Assassin’s Creed Origins\nSky - Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse\nYumemi Salon - Gravity Rush\nPyramid Sands - Kirby’s Epic Yarn\nCustomer Rewards - Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse\nSuture Self - Age of Mythology\nWalk Through the Park - TrackTribe\n\n - Chapters - \n\nIntroduction: 0:00\nCh. 1 - The Sands of Time: 4:30\nCh. 2 - The People's Medjay: 11:00\nCh. 3 - A Bustling Desolate: 23:15\nCh. 4 - The Birth of The Creed: 42:38\nCh. 5 - 4 Years Later: 1:04:40\nConclusion: 1:19:55\nPost-Script: 1:24:00\n\n\nAssassin's Creed Origins is a 2017 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the tenth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series. Principally set in Egypt, near the end of the Ptolemaic period (49–43 BC), the story follows a Medjay named Bayek of Siwa and his wife Aya, and explores the origins of the millennia-long conflict between the Hidden Ones—forerunners to the Assassin Brotherhood—who fight for peace by promoting liberty, and The Order of the Ancients—forerunners to the Templar Order—who desire peace through the forced imposition of order. The narrative also includes sequences set during the 21st century, which follow a new character, Layla Hassan. Featuring a large open world, Origins adopted elements from role-playing video games and incorporated an overhauled \"hitbox-based\" combat system.\n\nThe game's development began following the release of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (2013). Ubisoft Montreal led its four-year development with help from a team of nearly 700 people from other Ubisoft studios around the world. The team consulted Egyptologists and historians extensively to ensure the setting was authentically represented in the game. \n\nWelcome to Assassin's Creed Origins. In this Assassin's Creed Origins Review, which is long enough to be called an Assassin's Creed Origins Critique. Assassin's Creed Origins 4 Years Later, has seen alot of positive praise from fans and critics alike but in this Assassin's Creed Origins Analysis, we will look at why this is. This Assassin's Creed Origins Retrospective is a bit of a different one because, as I’m sure the title I HATE That I LOVE Assassin's Creed Origins implies, my feeling are a little conflicted. With the announcement of Assassin's Creed New games, it’s important to look back at Origins. I read Assassin's Creed Origins Guides, watched lets plays, played the game, watched Assassin's Creed Retrospectives, and studied Assassin's Creed Infinity, just to make sure I had all the information required. Video made by That Boy Aqua, and is the final RPG game in my That Boy Aqua Assassin's Creed series. I hate assassins creed origins, I love assassins creed origins, but hopefully I can find some middle ground."

        "description": "After a series of middling Spider-Man games, Activision handed Spider-Man's development over to Beenox. Activision tasked Beenox with rejuvenating the Spider-Man franchise with new ideas. Their new idea was to create a Spider-Verse game, featuring Spider-Man 2099, Spider-Man Noir, Amazing Spider-Man, and Ultimate Spider-Man in the symbiote suit. This idea would actually inspire writer Dan Slott to create a comic series titled \"Spider-Verse,\" which itself went on to inspire the movie \"Into The Spider-Verse.\"\n\nIn the game, our 4 Spider-Men must work together to stop Mysterio from claiming all the fragments of the Tablet of Order and Chaos. To reclaim the tablets fragments, we're taken on a journey through various levels, each featuring it's own villain. \n\nAlways Nerdy is a Youtube channel dedicated to all things nerdy and Marvel, with a focus on Marvel Gaming properties such as Marvel's Avengers and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance series. Retrospectives are a new series I've started, so more are on the way as well! \n\nGamereactor video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B1rYx9RMaI&t=350s\n\nAlways Nerdy Discord: \nhttps://discord.gg/sZ2PZQYbQD"

However, to me, it's not the best Ratchet and Clank game...it's another good one. It's the game where Insomniac's years of rushed development finally caught up to it. A Crack in Time is a game that simply shouldn't have been possible in its 10 short months of production, but it's a game that falls very short of its own goals because of that crunch.

        "description": "Futurasound Productions presents\n\"Erasing Zero: METAL GEAR SOLID 4 in Plain Sight\"\nA Jorin Lee EVE\n\n\"Our minds free from their prisons. That is the haven I've yearned for.\"\n- Liquid Ocelot\n\n\"For me to wake again... The System had to be destroyed... One way or another.\"\n- JD\n\nSupport me on Patreon for exclusive content, works cited, podcasts, Q&As, and more!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Futurasound\nFollow FSP on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/futurasound\n\nIt's now been over a decade since Hideo Kojima's towering, if controversial, METAL GEAR SOLID 4: GUNS OF THE PATRIOTS (2008). How has the game held up? What was it really all about, and why was it made this way? This, as long as it is,  is just one possible explanation.\n\n\"You have been given freedom. Freedom to be...Outside. You are nobody's tool now... No one's toy. You are no longer a prisoner of fate. You are no longer a seed of war. It's time for you to see the outside world with your own eyes. Your body... And your soul... Are your own. Forget about us. Live... For yourself. And find... A new lease on life. Boss... You only need one snake. No... The world would be better off without snakes. This is good... Isn't it?\"\n-JD\n\n\nBasically there are 3 Acts, with only the first Act segmented into explicit Parts. This, I thought up to unconsciously recall to mind the growth from childhood to old age, as being young feels like it takes so much longer!\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n\n2:32 - ACT ONE: CHILD STAGE\n01:19:44 - ACT TWO: ADULT STAGE\n01:53:44 - ACT THREE: OLD STAGE\n\n************\n\nMetal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots takes place in 2014, around 5 years after the events of MGS2, and sees an aged Solid Snake (now dubbed 'Old Snake') on his final mission to stop Liquid Ocelot and his PMC armies once and for all. It was intended as the conclusion of the Metal Gear Solid story, a fact that was played up throughout the game's marketing - most trailers showed Snake seemingly committing suicide at the conclusion of his mission.\n\nWhile serving as a direct narrative sequel to MGS2, most gameplay elements from MGS3 such as the 3D camera, CQC, and camouflage return, along with new features and a variety of new settings including active battlefields. A new Metal Gear Online game was included on the MGS4 disc (before later getting a standalone retail release in Japan), but was shut down on June 12, 2012.\n\nThe game was released exclusively on PlayStation 3 on June 12, 2008 and unlike other numbered MGS entries, has not received an updated release (á la Integral, Substance or Subsistence), nor a release on any other platform. Retail discs available from August 2012 are updated with the 2.0 patch.\n\nMetal Gear Solid 4 Database was released free of charge on the PlayStation Store just after MGS4's release. It's a companion application that serves as a guide to the complete Metal Gear canon up to the release of MGS4, with spoilers for that game locked until a completed MGS4 save is detected. MGS4 was shown running on PlayStation Vita hardware at a pre-launch press conference in Japan (specifically the scene from the original gameplay trailer, with Snake and Mk. II). No indication has been given that a full Vita version was ever being developed, though a (much) more primitive handheld adaptation was released on iOS as Metal Gear Solid Touch.\n\nhttps://www.giantbomb.com/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/3030-20669/"

We apologize for this inconvenience: this is, currently, the only way YouTube works.\n\nPlaylist selection is compatible with living room viewing via every video game console or device app we tested. Though again, you'll need to manually select a video as the beginning of Story #1 plays every time you want to switch stories.\n\nThanks for watching!

Death of a Game is a series dedicated to uncovering the mysteries surrounding the death of a game or company. nerdSlayer defines the term \"death\" in the context of the show as either... 1. Literally dead. 2. Had a mass exodus of players and never recovered (expectations etc). 3. The company ceased to exist. We follow a timeline of events, to uncover clues concerning why a game or company doesn't do well, and attempt to put it all together at the end for a deduction explaining how or why the game failed based on the evidence gathered.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Warcraft3/status/1224671468715421696\nhttps://twitter.com/Warcraft3/status/1222293661037273088\nhttps://twitter.com/Warcraft3/status/1255545020582518785\nhttps://playwarcraft3.com/en-us/\nhttps://www.w3champions.com/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nI10a1GR_jM\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2020/1/29/21113975/warcraft-3-reforged-downgrade-launch-issues-fan-response-cutscenes-performance-custom-games-dota\nhttps://www.polygon.com/blizzcon/2018/11/2/18057924/warcraft-3-reforged-classic-compatibility-blizzcon\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/au/warcraft-3-reforgeds-story-isnt-changing-to-fit-wow-because-people-love-the-voice-actors/\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20944518/warcraft-3-reforged-story-retcon-world-of-warcraft-wow\nhttps://twitter.com/Warcraft3/status/1189240252411645954?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1189240252411645954%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F2019%2F10%2F29%2F20938585%2Fwarcraft-3-reforged-multiplayer-beta-launch\nhttps://www.gamepur.com/guides/how-to-switch-from-classic-to-reforged-graphics-in-warcraft-3-reforged\nhttps://www.dexerto.com/gaming/warcraft-3-players-upset-missing-features-reforged-release-1320634/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/warcraft3/comments/evfop0/features_that_were_removed_from_original_warcraft/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\nhttps://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/warcraft3/t/reforged-is-a-forced-downgrade-for-classic-users/14852\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-22/inside-activision-blizzard-s-botched-warcraft-iii-reforged-game\nhttps://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal/2749df07-2b53-4990-b75e-a7cb3610318b/custom-game-acceptable-use-policy\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2020/02/01/warcraft-3-reforged-was-clearly-not-ready-for-release--so-why-did-blizzard-rush-it-out/?sh=2b7f93f82c87\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2020/02/01/warcraft-3-reforged-was-clearly-not-ready-for-release--so-why-did-blizzard-rush-it-out/?sh=2b7f93f82c87\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/warcraft-3-reforged-includes-the-frozen-throne-multiplayer-will-be-compatible-with-the-original/\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2019/12/17/21026923/warcraft-3-reforged-delay-2020-blizzard-entertainment\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-3-reforged-fans-unhappy-with-launch-version\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/warcraft-3-reforged-controversy/\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-3-reforged-fans-unhappy-with-launch-version\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/warcraft-3-reforged-controversy/\nhttps://www.techgamingreport.com/blizzard-absorbs-activision-studio-after-dismantling-the-classic-game-team/\nhttps://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/warcraft-iii-reforged\nhttps://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/warcraft-iii-reforged/user-reviews\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2020/01/31/warcraft-3-reforged-has-a-record-low-08-score-on-metacritic-as-fans-are-furious/?sh=2930032076fc\nhttps://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/warcraft-3-reforged-is-now-the-worst-user-scored-game-ever-on-metacritic/\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/warcraft-3-reforged-has-the-lowest-user-score-for-a-game-on-metacritic/\nhttps://www.dexerto.com/gaming/activision-blizzard-disaster-behind-warcraft-iii-reforged-revealed-by-devs-1616790/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAS9kbESWA4&t=8409s\nhttps://liquipedia.net/warcraft/Warcraft_III_Invitational\nhttps://liquipedia.net/warcraft/Patch_1.29.0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvO-1EKjB6c&t=334s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwpeCquB57Q&t=1404s\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-says-warcraft-3-reforged-cutscenes-preserve-the-true-spirit-of-the-game/\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2020/2/3/21120965/warcraft-3-reforged-blizzard-refunds-ticket-instant\nhttps://www.gamesradar.com/uk/warcraft-3-reforged-has-the-worst-user-scored-game-on-metacritic/\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/warcraft-3-reforged-review/"

For how obscure and forgotten it is, this is a surprisingly brilliant and brutally overlooked survival horror title. Co-directed by none other than Goichu Suda aka Suda 51, it’s a brilliantly crafted, soil-your-pants-scary, genuine Fatal Frame that brings a handful of new innovations to the formula, including claustrophobia-inducing over-the-shoulder camera and hauntinly immersive motion controls, and the fact that Nintendo lets it rot in their vaults is an *unpunished capital crime*.\n\n\n\nMONSTERS OF THE WEEK: FATAL FRAME 4 - MASK OF THE LUNAR ECLIPSE\n\n#FatalFrameReview #ProjectZero #FatalFrame4 #MonstersOfTheWeek\n\nLuckily there exists a phenomenal fan translation.

Shin Megami Tensei 4 Apocalypse is one of the most popular games in the series and in this SMT 4 Apocalypse Analysis, I'm going to be reviewing Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse. There will be story spoilers in this Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse Review for Shin Megami Tensei IV and Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne because I compare them to SMT 4 Apocalypse. Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse Dividing a Fanbase is just my own opinion on Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse. If you disagree with me, that's okay. This Shin Megami Tensei 4 Apocalypse analysis is a follow-up to my Shin Megami Tensei IV analysis, so make sure you watch that as well. Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse Dividing a Fanbase is the best video I've made. \n\n0:00 Opening\n1:03 SMT IV Apocalypse Introduction\n4:49 How Apocalypse Refines SMT IV's Mechanics\n17:24 World Design & DLC\n26:04 Character & Alignment Critique\n40:01 Conclusion\n41:25 Outro & Channel Supporter Credits\n\nShin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse is one of the most divisive games in the entire franchise. What was originally envisioned as an enhanced rerelease of SMT IV eventually mutated into something much more ambitious. Despite Apocalypse reusing a lot of assets from IV, it’s its own beast entirely as it features all-new characters, a new story, updated mechanics, and much more. The game was released in February of 2016 in Japan and in September for us western players. Critically speaking, Apocalypse was received rather. Fan reaction, however, was a different story. There’s a lot of people that love this game to death, and just as many that cite it as one of the worst megaten titles. So for today’s video, we’re going to take a deep dive into Apocalypse to find out why it has such a mixed reception amongst fans."

That’s what I’ve been hoping I can say about this game for a year now. This is one of my favorite franchises that has so much potential but so often falls flat. Ever since Far Cry 3 I’ve loved these games but nothing has even come close to 3’s fantastically well written and performed villain, Vaas, or its cohesion within the game world. But with this game coming I knew there was a chance we could have an upset... After all, Far Cry 6 is the hotly anticipated next entry in the long and storied franchise that has struggled with its identity for the last few entries. Once a grounded and gritty first person shooter, the series has fallen victim to the populist in tropes that have ruined so many intellectual properties before it. In recent years Far Cry has given up many of the realistic mechanics in pursuit of larger maps, more approachable gunplay, and repetitious gameplay structure. But Far Cry 6 is Ubisoft’s attempt at a return to form for the beloved franchise. They’ve focused on the writing, they’ve brought in A list talent in the form of Giancarlo Esposito, and an active effort has been made to give all the weapons a unique feel and style. But is it enough to make this game the best in the franchise or does it fall flat once again?

        "description": "In this video, we take a close look at The Witcher 1 (2007) — the first entry of the incredible Witcher trilogy. At the time of its release, CD Projekt RED was not the triple-A studio it is today. They were a small-to-mid-sized Polish developer, so it shouldn't surprise you that the game isn't perfect. Its combat is clunky, its presentation is spotty, and the lack of fast travel can be frustrating without a speed mod for Geralt (linked below).\n\nBut there's something about this game. You can tell it was made by talented people who were passionate about the world they were creating. And they did one hell of a job.\n\nAfter my 60+ hours with this game, I can confidently recommend you give the game a try. If you can look past the rough edges, you're going to be in for one amazing ride.\n\nIs it perfect? No. Do you need to play it before you give The Witcher 3 a go? I don't think so. But it's a damn good game that does a great job introducing you to Geralt's universe and will have you remembering Vizima for the rest of your life. \n\nThis is my first video, so your thoughts on it, good or bad, are greatly appreciated!

Caddicarus is FINALLY back in the first Caddicarus episode about Crash Bandicoot for 2021. The PC problems may be awful, but at least those PC issues can’t get in the way of Bandicoot Month! Today, as Caddicarus Crash Bandicoot review videos seem to go down okay (even though I don’t classify my stuff as reviews anymore) I figured it would be fun to carry on from my old Crash Bandicoot XS review or Crash Bandicoot The Huge Adventure review on the Gameboy Advance, and naturally take a shot at a Crash 2 N Tranced review on GBA. But hey, a Caddicarus Crash 2 N Tranced review on its own is no fun. And how about a Caddicarus Crash Purple review? Crash Fusion? I did do a video on Spyro Orange or Spyro Fusion on the GBA, so that makes sense to show off Crash Bandicoot Gameboy Advance gameplay on all fronts - including Crash Nitro Kart GBA. But then, we went down the rabbit hole. If I was already gonna cover all the Nintendo Gameboy games in 1 video, then why not look at the Nintendo DS Crash Bandicoot games? There’s Crash Boom Bang gameplay with a Crash Boom Bang review (again, not really a review, but I don’t know what else to call it for YouTube to recognise the stupid stuff I do), and even Crash of the Titans DS gameplay, Mind Over Mutant DS gameplay, and then OH MY, there’s also the Crash Bandicoot PSP games! Tag Team Racing PSP gameplay with a Tag Team Racing review, Mind Over Mutant PSP gameplay, Crash of the Titans PSP gameplay - and no, it doesn’t end there. Did you know that Tiger Electronics had a crash game? Yep, the Tiger LCD Games that the AVGN made infamous - they got their mitts on Cash Banooca. From Angry Video Game Nerd Tiger Electronics to Caddy - get ready to see Crash Bandicoot 99x, which was actually the first ever portable crash game. Tiger Electronics Crash Bandicoot. What. And that’s not all - how about the free McDonald’s Happy Meal games? Crash Bandicoot Happy Meal and Spyro Happy Meal games were a thing - CRASH BANDICOOT MCDONALDS GAMES ARE A THING, WHAT. Oh, and then there’s the Crash Bandicoot Java games like Mutant Island gameplay, Crash Bandicoot ExEn gameplay with an Infusio emulator - Java Mobile phone games had crash, with lots of Twinsanity Mobile versions, and then there’s Nitro Kart 3D iOS and Nitro Kart 2 iOS - and speaking of iPhone, we even round off with a Crash On the Run review with Crash on the Run gameplay for the iPhone, even though it’s also Android as well as iOS. I’m gonna sleep now, this was an effort to type.\n\n\nCaddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo\n\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos\n\nKevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = http://incompetech.com\n\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = https://www.youtube.com/SuperOllyRoss\n\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my Crash on the Run review on my channel! | Caddicarus\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#CrashBandicoot #Bandicoot #Caddicarus #PSP #GBA #GameBoy"

Not to be confused with Corpse Husband. This video has been one of the hardest videos I ever will make as this took the entirety of 5 months of non-stop work since the last video so hopefully the wait between this one and the RPG Maker video was worth it! Obviously from the title of the video you've been warned, so go into the game franchise with some caution! Thank you so much for all the support on all of my channels since my last video and hopefully the algorithm is nice to me on this one. Thanks for 250,000 subscribers and I hope to see you in the next video!

Marvel Nemesis included characters such as Daredevil, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Venom, and Human Torch against original EA characters named, \"The Imperfects.\" Marvel Nemesis received both poor critical and financial success, causing it to be the only game to release within the Marvel/EA contract.

And I'm not just talking about the Star Wars of it all either. \n\nThis is the Star Wars game that I wanted since… forever. I get that some of you will have fond memories of Force Unleashed, and The Force Unleashed 1 and 2 was great, but the lightsaber game I have fond memories of is actually Revenge of the Sith. For a licenced game it let me live out my Jedi power fantasy, and my sister and I would lose hours in the multiplayer duels. \nSo when I saw Fallen Order’s E3 Demo, I thought… hell yeah, sure. If the developer behind Titanfall and Apex Legends was getting a crack at a single-player Star Wars action game, I was all for it. And they’re borrowing from the Soulslike formula to boot? Well I can’t get enough of a decent Soulslike! But even though I was interested in the game, I couldn’t help but feel like Respawn were trying to please the crowd, rather than carving their own path. They’re rearing a pig and sloppily slapping some second-hand lipstick on it.\nBut I know I’m not alone in saying that Jedi: Fallen Order was an engaging and pleasant surprise when I finally sat down with it. It’s a solid adventure, with a fun story, addictive combat, and any of its flaws – of which there are a fair few – often get batted aside when you unwrap some more of the glossy Star Wars packaging.\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n\n0:00:00 - Introduction: Lipstick On A Pig\n0:06:30 - Episode 1: The Phantom Tutorial\n0:34:25 - Episode 2: Attack of the Level Design\n0:54:34 - Episode 3: Revenge of the Gameplay\n01:22:04 - Episode 4: A New Force\n01:39:12 - Episode 5: The Lipstick Strikes Back\n01:54:38 - Episode 6: Return of the Jedi\n\n\nFOOTAGE/REFERENCES USED\n\n1) Madeyewlook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1WjOG8wiSs\n2) Jordan Hanz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BApZIzcdxII&t=514s\n3) Jeffree Starr: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOuwNiCa-zU\n4) Glam and Gore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ9vRS1GbwQ\n5) danielzrotfl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rybb9uFWAoc&t=138s\n6) CharmieJanee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVIPT2FJ1R8\n7) Amber Rose Oatman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4Bc0HZ4AW8&t=9s\n8) Monique Matos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbizbwEfEOI&t=527s"

It’s also borderline offensive in its handling of the very serious crisis. Watchdogs meets Brexit sounds like a fascinating, complex match made in heaven… but what we got was an abomination. No Season Pass content, or Aiden Pearce inclusion is going to fix this. The game was a failure in principle, and shocking in practice. And that kinda just bums me out, so hoped that this wee angry breakdown will help.\n\nThis means we’re getting political in this video. I know a lot of you joined the channel from my Bloodborne analysis, and I’ve had a couple of comments asking me to discuss some of my politics in more depth – so figured using Legion as a vehicle to do that could be quite fun!\n\nFOOTAGE/REFERENCES USED\n1) IGN: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L20nioDjCxU\n2) BBC Three: https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2266834900208150\n3) Defend The House: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrUJJgppMn4\n4) TNT World: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Whs--TgiLk\n5) NHS Privatisation: https://keepournhspublic.com/privatisation-is-already-killing-the-nhs/ - NHS\n6) Ruba: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKh4_KWn9Zc&t=74s\n7) YOUNG_SYLVR: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ex6SjXK5bQ&t=33s\n8) FactPointVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC8qO1nyYoM&t=885s\n9) MovieClips: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC8qO1nyYoM&t=885s\n\nMUSIC\n1 - Mr Robot Theme by Mac Quayle - Composer of \"Mr Robot.\"\n\n#WatchDogsLegion #Critique #Ubisoft"

That's pretty cool. Kinda wished I'd waited a couple more months before I made this video so the remastered footage would look crisper. \n\nUPDATE: ALAN WAKE 2 IS REAL AND COMING IN 2023 BABY\n\nAlan Wake is a game which pulls heavily from numerous vibes. Stephen King, In The Mouth of Madness, the Twilight Zone, and Twin Peaks, all chiming out a tune that’s both colourful and monochrome. When I played it 11 years ago I was enthralled by its story, by its characters, its thrills, chills, and exploration of writer’s block, but I didn’t have anything close to an understanding of where the game’s inspirations came from. \n\nSo, that’s what we’re going to do here. I have extremely fond memories of Alan’s nightmare, so thought I’d put that nostalgia to the test by walking through the game. Is it an effective horror? Is its story still interesting? \nYou don’t need to have watched Twin Peaks to enjoy this video, but I will be discussing some details of the show while we go, especially the end of Season 2. \n\n#AlanWakeCritique #AlanWakeAnalysis #ControlAWE\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n0:00:00 - A Story\n0:03:41 - Introduction\n0:07:05 - Episode 1 - Alan, Wake Up (The Opening)\n0:32:38 - Episode 2 - Alan Can't Run (Gameplay)\n0:51:56 - Episode 3 - Alan, I'm Scared (The Horror)\n01:10:57 - Episode 4 - Alan, Are You Okay?

If Alan Wake went Beyond Inspiration, Control, arguably, goes even further.\n\nBut for all of the great that’s in here,  the game  avoids being called a Masterpiece because it doesn’t fully embrace its weirdness in a mechanical sense. \n\nAt points it sludges through some really trite, and really dull modern game design which holds it back from being a truly unique experience.\nFor a lot of people, I know this was their 2019 Game of the Year, and while it’s not mine, I do think it’s well worth that title. It’s a game of peaks and valleys. What it does well it does incredibly well, but when it’s naff… it’s really naff.

It shouldn’t, but it does. Like it has always existed. Like the snow, and the mountains, and the trees have groaned and shuddered with years of gothic romance and Grimm fairytales reshaping it. The residents understand its seasons, debate the intricacies of its culture, and you feel that familiarity as well once you reach the halfway mark, despite how regularly the game changes its scenarios and settings. It flits epileptically between Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty, and some of the most disturbing horror I’ve ever had the displeasure to live in, yet somehow it all manifests like one cohesive whole: a gothic fairytale.\nBut saying all of that;\nAs much as I like this game, hell, I might even love this game – it’s not perfect. Especially on a second or third playthrough, the thrill dies. Though lucky for us, I think its flaws are as interesting as its wins. It is worth noting here that this series is notorious for being… accidentally brilliant in a lot of ways. Be it mechanical limitations, or cheesy translations in the past, whether or not any of the things I’ll mark were intentional by the designers is for you to decide.\n\nWe’ll be walking through the full story of the game – so spoilers ahead, analysing it in a literary sense as a fairytale, but also in a mechanical sense as a horror game\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n00:00:00 - Introduction\n00:04:50 - Part 1: Goldilocks and the Three Winters - The Opening\n00:16:55 - Part 2: Ethan in Wonderland - The Village,Tension & Atmosphere\n00:30:42 - Part 3: Creeping Beauty - Castle Dimitrescu & The Beautification of Horror\n00:44:14 - Part 4: Ben-etto - Donna Beneviento & Environmental Storytelling\n01:01:02 - Part 5: The Little Merman - Moreau & The Duke\n01:15:58 - Part 6: The Elves and the Soldatmaker - Heisenberg & Combat\n01:34:20 - Part 7: Happily Never After - Mother Miranda, The Ending, Sequel Theories\n\n\n\n\nMUSIC\nMusic used is owned and created by MonoMemory - their covers and remixes of Resident Evil songs are incredible.

I understand why some may not enjoy vague story telling or tale spinners who leave much up to the imagination, but I find it captivating. I personally love it when a story teller doesn’t spoon feed everything; when elements of the story or the characters’ motivations are left up to my imagination or deduction.

Interactive Entertainment. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to the 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum and the second installment in the Batman: Arkham series. Written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini with Paul Crocker and Sefton Hill, Arkham City is inspired by the long-running comic book mythos. In the game's main storyline, Batman is incarcerated in Arkham City, a huge new super-prison enclosing the decaying urban slums of fictional Gotham City. He must uncover the secret behind the sinister scheme, \"Protocol 10\", orchestrated by the facility's warden, Hugo Strange. The game's leading characters are predominantly voiced by actors from the DC Animated Universe, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker, respectively.\n\n#Gaming #Batman #BatmanArkhamCity\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubscribe and I'll be your bestest friend!"

        "description": "Arkham Knight was released June 23rd of 2015 and received a mixed reception. Many enjoyed the game but still felt as though it relied too heavily on its Batmobile gimmick. Others, mostly PC players, were furious at the terrible PC port they received. In fact, the port was so terribly done that Warner Brothers ceased all PC sales of the game until it was resolved. Regardless, many have a negative opinion of the game yet have not played it. Because of this, this video is going to deep-dive into the intricacies of how the game works and how well it wraps up the franchise.

        "description": "Uncharted marked a huge shift for Naughty Dog. In my estimation, it was their first foray into what could be branded as \"adult entertainment.\" Not like… THAT, but you know, in the literal sense of the words. Entertainment, meant for those over the age of 18. Its goal was to tell a more mature story, with darker themes, romance, wit, and even… \"COMEDY\" [CLIPS] All told, the game was… Ok. It was clearly a new thing for the team and despite their best efforts there were a lot of problems. However, as I'm sure you know by now, Naughty Dog eventually figured it out and were able to put out some of the most critically acclaimed titles ever released under the banner of \"Uncharted.\"\n This video is the first in a series of critiques and analyses on the Uncharted Series. I'll be going through every game in the franchise, even Lost Legacy, which even Naughty Dog seems to want to bury (something which I'll discuss at length in that game's video).

Blood Omen 2 continued on the story whilst the company was being taken over by Eidos and eventually Square, before the Rocket League studio themselves (Psyonix) started work on a multiplayer deathmatch. Whilst several other games (most notable dark phoenix and dead sun) were cancelled!\nYep, this is one complicated story with a crazy amount of mishaps along the way, but still, fans love it. And hopefully you this video will entice you to pick up one of the earlier titles and get you teeth stuck into this awesome franchise\n--- \nFor a list of resources used for this video click here… https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KOzQzfmlFkzUoKF0xvxih3SG8eUKxBD8yb8nu6LHbsg/edit?usp=sharing\n---\n⌛ The Complete History Series… https://goo.gl/CMCMvQ\nThe ultimate in-depth documentary look at all your favourite gaming franchises such as...

Please enjoy and share with your buddies who may also like Dimitri and/or Three Houses!\n---\nIn this Support Science, I want to explore the three stages of Dimitri’s mentality as he edges to the point of losing his grip on reality and his lifelong climb back when he goes over that point. At the center of this internal struggle lies two of Dimitri's most important values: the compassion for the living and the compassion for the dead. In this video, I will chronologically outline his journey, and in doing so, hone in on how all of the above mentioned values, especially the two I specifically mentioned just above, change and influence him. Through a critical analysis of  the Tragedy of Duscur, Edelgard’s betrayal, and Cornelia’s tyranny, into his isolation in Garreg Mach, I will explore how he goes from a kindhearted and compassionate teenager into a man so beaten down, psychologically destroyed and isolated so as to be unrecognizeable. Then I will examine how, when confronted by his peers and those he loves, Dimitri’s morality once again transforms to lead him back to a path towards redemption. It is popular to say, even in-game, that Dimitri’s journey “returns him to normal,” but I disagree. I argue Dimitri was never “normal” from the start. Rather, his journey is one that takes him from a man hounded by his conscience to serve the dead to a man, though he cannot control it, is willing to confront reality - the good and bad - for what it is. \n(Choose Your Legends Dimitri just got announced in Fire Emblem Heroes. What an absolute unit.)\n---\nSubscribe: https://goo.gl/1xHJzR\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/GhastPatreon\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ghaaast\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/keegandmeyer\n---\nScript Contributors:\nDisappointturtle https://twitter.com/disappointurtle\nNeko Knight\n---\nAudio Editing:\nFishyFried https://twitter.com/FishyFried\nDimitri Impression:\nskurletonVA https://twitter.com/skurletonVA\n---\nGame Footage provided by:\njust1oneGamr: https://www.youtube.com/user/justonegamr\nYic17 Studio: https://www.youtube.com/user/yic17\nArticles used:\nhttps://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/guide/what-is-psychosis#1-2\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/raise/what-is-psychosis.shtml\n---\n#FireEmblemThreeHouses, #FE3H, #DimitriAlexandreBlaiddyd"

How she became driven to fight so hard for her survival, why she became the Flame Emperor, why she betrayed her friends and how she succeeded in her goal. The first section of this video goes in detail, over her origins and provides context for her actions: How her abuse as a child at the hands of her Uncle and TWSITD sparked her desire to reform and avenge the crimes done to her and her family. The second section discusses her time in the Academy, as both the idealistic and kind-hearted young heir to the throne, and the cold and pragmatic Flame Emperor. How does Edelgard balance between fighting for what she believes in, yet fighting with her sworn enemies at the same time? Then, it critically analysizes Edelgard in her support conversations, exploring how she is multifaceted, introspective and, well, chill. The third section, as you may expect, discusses Edelgard’s characterization in Crimson Flower and spotlights her relationship with Dimitri, contention with Rhea and last, provides a critique on Crimson Flower and how it could have further improved her character.  The next section deeply explores her relationship with Byleth and discusses how the Professor serves as a foil for her. And finally, it will remove Edelgard from the hands of the player and explore her characterization as a villain. As a former ally and student into opposing emperor in Silver Snow, and from merely a peer to Byleth into the Hegemon Husk in Azure Moon. Edelgard’s a strong woman who shoulders the pain of her tragic past, which drives her to create a better future for everyone. She is both cold and compassionate, self centered and empathetic, unrelenting and introspective. Edelgard is a morally ambiguous character and this support science aims to understand why. As well as observe her excellent highs, lows, and everything else in between. \n---\nSubscribe: https://goo.gl/1xHJzR\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/GhastPatreon\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ghaaast\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/keegandmeyer\nStreaming:\nTwitch Streams: https://www.twitch.tv/faerghast​\nYouTube Streams: https://bit.ly/3vmt3Sr​ (Its the old archive channel)\n---\nScript Contributors:\nDisappointturtle https://twitter.com/disappointurtle\nNeko Knight\n---\nScript Editors:\nDisappointturtle\nNeko Knight\nTheLinkKing https://www.youtube.com/user/LinkKing7\nMoltz23 https://twitter.com/Moltz20\nHana Kizehhe https://twitter.com/Hana_Kizehhe\nViseak https://www.youtube.com/user/Viseak\nkalegoblin https://twitter.com/kalegoblin\n---\nAudio Editing:\nFishyFried https://twitter.com/FishyFried\n---\nGame Footage provided by:\nYic17 Studio: https://www.youtube.com/user/yic17\nCollector Togami: https://www.youtube.com/user/Livingtheaspielife\n#FireEmblem, #Edelgard, #ThreeHouses"

        "description": "A full history of the Metal Gear franchise. From Hideo Kojima joining Konami's MSX division, to the most recent rumors regarding Bluepoint and the mysterious \"BlueBox Studio.\" \n\nCelebrate nearly 35 years of one of the most iconic stealth action video games of all time by learning how the series has evolved! Metal Gear is a stealth action video game series created by Hideo Kojima and produced by a Japanese holding company called Konami. The series began as an MSX pixel stealth action game, and has grown to be one of the greatest - most recognizable video games in the history of the medium. This documentary will cover it all, including: Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, the NES releases like Snake's Revenge, the highly influential Metal Gear Solid on the PlayStation, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, all of the PSP and Gameboy releases, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and everything in-between! \n\nJoin me as I detail each and every game, breaking down their development history, storyline, gameplay features, visuals, and their critical reception, all backed with each game's original soundtrack. \n________________________ \n\nGOGcom Sponsorship Information:\n\nThis video is brought to you in part by GOG.com.

        "description": "This is the story of one broken promise, a promise that's hurt every Ratchet & Clank game since 2007's Tools of Destruction.\n\nRatchet & Clank has always been defined by its ambition, and this ambition was never clearer than with the PS3's Ratchet & Clank Future Saga: A multi-game story arc that aimed to be too big for any one game.  However, some of the folks at Insomniac Games had promised much more than they could achieve, telling Sony representatives that R&C Future: Tools of Destruction would have full multiplayer and co-op support - features that were NEVER in production.  The Future Saga would never recover from this promise, as Insomniac rushed to \"make it up\" to their upset publisher, and the Ratchet & Clank series has paid the price for it ever since.\n\nA Crack in Time Retrospective: https://youtu.be/GbzyTqLjrso\n\nSubscribe for more!  http://bit.ly/TGBSub\nSupport future videos!  http://www.patreon.com/TheGoldenBolt\nFollow me on Twitter!  http://www.twitter.com/TheGoldenBolt\nBecome a Channel Member! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIySeFc0rD9_WK5CRCuB_oA/join\n\n\n\"The Golden Bolt Theme\" composed by AllHailBuckets.

Set five years after The Last of Us (2013), the game focuses on two playable characters in a post-apocalyptic United States whose lives intertwine: Ellie, who sets out for revenge after suffering a tragedy, and Abby, a soldier who becomes involved in a conflict between her militia and a religious cult. The game is played from the third-person perspective and allows the player to fight human enemies and cannibalistic zombie-like creatures with firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth.\n\nDevelopment of The Last of Us Part II began in 2014, soon after the release of The Last of Us Remastered. Neil Druckmann returned as creative director, co-writing the story with Halley Gross. The game's themes of revenge and retribution were inspired by Druckmann's experiences growing up in Israel. Ashley Johnson reprises her role as Ellie, while Laura Bailey was cast as Abby. Their performances included the simultaneous recording of motion and voice. The developers pushed the technical capabilities of the PlayStation 4 during development. Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose and perform the score. Development reportedly included a crunch schedule of 12-hour workdays.\n\nFollowing some delays, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Last of Us Part II was released on June 19, 2020. It received critical acclaim, with praise for its characters, gameplay, performances, and visual fidelity, though the narrative and the representation of a transgender character polarized critics and players. It was the subject of review bombing on Metacritic, and discourse surrounding the game was observed to have become adversarial. Part II is one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games and the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 exclusive, with over four million units sold in its release weekend. It holds the record for most Game of the Year awards, and received multiple other accolades from awards shows and gaming publications. \n\nThe Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective featuring elements of the survival horror genre.[1][2] The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.[3] Control intermittently switches between Ellie and Abby;[1] the player also briefly controls Joel in the opening sequence.[4] The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements to the game, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat.[5] The player can break glass objects such as windows to access certain areas or obtain supplies.[6] Some areas in the game are navigated by horse or boat.[3][7]\n\n#TheLastofUsPart2 #TheLastofUs #jayvee"

It was just a one time purchase made after playing the game for a couple months, at a time when I had no idea I'd end up making a video about the game.

I mean, sure, it certainly has it’s cult following, a cult of which I am a part of but when telling some friends that I was making videos on both the first Mirrors Edge and Mirror's Edge Catalyst I was met with the response of “What’s that?”. Now I am by no means trying to say that I am uncovering a dusty classic or something because in the grand scheme of things this game is not very old however it’s important to remember that EA’s expectations for games were very skewed given that they publish a lot of the most popular sports games. They likely wanted Catalyst to be a major player in the next generation. \n\n Furthermore, Mirror's Edge Catalyst, the first entry in what I think is a planned reboot series, is just something fans don’t really talk about as much and I think it’s for good reason. There are some decisions that people will either like or not like about this game and I think the biggest factor in what they like is... Perspective.\n\n Now, I think perspective is something important to consider when trying to evaluate Mirror's Edge Catalyst. This is because I believe that someone's expectations for a game are directly tied to their perspective of the product going into it and I want to clarify that expectations and perspective are not the same as being biased. I was biased towards this game from the get go because I love games with solid movement systems and further because I loved the first Mirror's Edge. But my expectations for Mirror's Edge Catalyst were heavily influenced by the marketing and I think that is why I was generally pleased with the experience. \n\n\n- Chapters - \nThe Best Part: 0:00\nIntroduction: 1:13\nA Utopian Future: 6:26\nLike A Bicycle: 11:05\nLinear Freedom: 23:53\nI Don't Like The Story Very Much: 38:54\nClosing Thoughts: 55:40\nPost Script: 58:32\n\nWritten and edited by That Boy Aqua.\n\nThis is Mirror's Edge Catalyst in 2021. Mirror's Edge Catalyst in 2022 and any other year after will be the same. This Mirror's Edge Catalyst Critique and Mirror's Edge Catalyst Analysis was a lot of fun to work on and I enjoyed revisiting Mirror's Edge Catalyst years later. I also have an original Mirror's Edge Critique and Mirror's Edge Analysis. With those done I just couldn't wait to answer the question: Is Mirror's Edge Catalyst Good? is the Mirror's Edge Catalyst gameplay fun? Well, I answer that in this Mirror's Edge Catalyst Review which also functions as a Mirror's Edge Catalyst Story Explained video since the comic tie-in muddies the plot. What Happened to Mirror's Edge and the associated comic was terrible and I go into more detail in this video. This is not a Mirror's Edge Catalyst guide, but this is the best parkour game,"

Persona 1 is a game that doesn't have nearly as much discussion surrounding it as it should. In this Persona 1 Review, I will be analyzing and critiquing Persona 1 on both the Playstation 1 and the Playstation Portable. This Persona 1 analysis will contain spoilers for Persona 1 and will go over some localization changes. This is a follow up to my Persona 4 analysis, so make sure you watch that as well. This Persona 1 review will contain spoilers as it's an in-depth analysis. \n\n0:00 Opening\n1:16 Persona 1 Introduction\n4:29 This Game is First-Person?\n5:32 Battle System & Overall Balance\n14:12 Sebec Route Story & Character Critique\n24:15 Revelations Persona & Snow Queen introduction\n28:19 Snow Queen Quest Gameplay Differences\n31:29 Snow Queen Story Analysis & Conclusion\n38:00 Patreon Credits & Outro\n\n\n\nIf you were to ask people their opinions on the Persona franchise, an overwhelming majority would assume that the topic of the conversation would be about the quality of Persona 3, Persona 4 or Persona 5. As a self proclaimed massive Persona fan, I am very guilty of this school of thought. It got me thinking, why don’t people talk about the Persona games prior to Persona 3 nearly as much. That’s not to say that there isn’t discussion surrounding the classic games, in fact, Persona 2 in particular is a favourite among quite a few people. But a game that almost no one seems to talk about is the game that kicked off of this smt spinoff series to begin with. So I’ve decided that for the next couple of Persona videos, I’ll be giving the spotlight to these games.\n\nThis is actually my first time playing through Persona 1, and I’ll be using the playstation portable remaster that was released back in 2009 for the basis of the video. Persona 1’s north american playstation 1 release is actually very infamous because of how many things were altered or just straight up removed from the game. Thankfully, the playstation portable translation is much more faithful to the japanese source and the missing content has been restored. I’ll go into more detail about the original translation when I talk about the snow queen quest as I think it’s actually very interesting."

In this SMT Nocturne Analysis, I'll be reviewing and critiquing SMT Nocturne. SMT Nocturne HD is coming out soon, so I wanted to analyze the game's themes and go over why this game is so special. Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne is about the Price of Creation and what you're willing to sacrifice in order to see your ideals through. This is not a SMT Nocturne Review, but it's a SMT Nocturne Analysis. \"Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne Analysis - The Price of Creation\" is one of the best videos I made and was only made possible thanks to the support of you guys. I hope you enjoy my Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne Analysis. \n\nIt’s hard to think of many other games that are like Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne. Even when taking the entirety of Atlus’s catalogue into consideration, you’d be hard-pressed to find any other title that matches Nocturne in terms of tone, the type of story that is presented, and the themes that are conveyed. Which is doubly impressive when looking at the sheer number of games in Atlus’s Megami Tensei franchise. So, what exactly is Nocturne and what does this game do to stand out from the crowd of other RPGs on the PlayStation 2."

In this Persona 2 Innocent Sin Analysis I'll be looking at the highs and lows of Persona 2. This means this will also be a Persona 2 Innocent Sin Critique. Persona 2 Innocent Sin Review Sins of our Past is inspired by certain events that take place in the game where the characters reflect on their Past Sins Hopefully, this video does inspire you to check out Persona 2 whether that be Innocent Sin or Persona 2 Eternal Punishment.

So after taking a small break from the series, I’m more motivated than ever to get back into the swing of things. Despite my personal feelings towards the original Persona, the game sold very well, especially when you consider the size of Atlus at the time. Atlus would be crazy to not capitalize on this success and around three years later in 1999 we were introduced to Persona 2 Innocent sin… only in Japan. \n\nAlright let’s just get into this now. Persona 2 is actually a duology. The first part, innocent sin, was originally never released worldwide initially. The reasoning for which has never been officially stated, but it’s most likely because some of the game’s imagery could’ve stirred up a lot of controversy. We did however end up getting the second part of the duology, Eternal Punishment, in the year 2000."

I highly suggest you play Innocent Sin yourself or watch my video on the game to get extra context for my review of Eternal Punishment.\n\nPersona 2 Innocent Sin is a good game overall. Sure, I think that the PSP remaster definitely butchered the combat mechanics to a large extent. But what kept me going through all of that was the game’s story and cast of characters. Innocent Sin ended on a sombre note. Despite our heroes' best efforts, they couldn’t stop the world from being destroyed by Nyarlathotep. The only solution to this problem was to erase the group's memories of meeting each other. By doing so, a new timeline is created where the events of Innocent Sin never happened. At the end of the day, it seems as though the childhood friends were destined to stay apart."

Persona 3 Portable is the PSP port of Persona 3 FES on the PS2. In this Persona 3 Portable Review, I'll be discussing why the game is One Step Forward and One Step Back for Persona 3 FES. This Persona 3 Portable Analysis is a follow up to my Persona 3 FES analysis and Persona 4 Analysis, so make sure you watch those videos as well. This Persona 3 Portable review will contain spoilers for both Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable. \n\nThis Persona 3 Portable Review One Step Forward, One Step Back got its name due to the game's overall quality.

About one year ago, I released my video on Persona 3 Fes for the PlayStation 2. A video that despite its flaws, is one that I’m ultimately still proud of. Admittedly, however, part of me always thought that my look at Persona 3 was somewhat incomplete. Which I know might sound weird to some people due to the fact that I covered both The Journey and The Answer. What exactly is there left to talk about involving Persona 3? The answer is quite simple, I still haven’t covered the PSP port that was released in 2009. \n\nYou see, Persona 3 portable is far more than just a handheld version of an existing game. There are a lot of additions and changes made from Persona 3 Fes that, at the end of the day, make this it’s own separate experience entirely. My thoughts on Persona 3 FES are basically unchanged since I released that original video. The changes that Persona 3 Portable introduces range from smaller ones such as changing how overworld exploration works to something major such as the brand new female protagonist option."

While this game hasn’t exactly reached mainstream success yet, it does have a pretty decent following. The game originally released for the Nintendo DS back in 2007 before receiving an enhanced rerelease on the Nintendo Switch in late 2018. Somewhat recently, we also received the announcement of a direct sequel to the game as well as an anime adaptation. So for today’s video, we’re going to be looking at why this game left such an impact on people and whether or not I fully agree with the praise or criticism this game has garnered."

Persona Q has a lot of Missed Potential and this Persona Q Review will be going over why Persona Q is like that. This Persona Q review will contain spoilers as it's an in-depth analysis. \n\nPersona Q Analysis Missed Potential is going to be an unbiased look at Persona Q. If you like Persona Q, then you should watch this video so I can show you why Persona Q has a lot of Missed Potential in this Persona Q Review.\n\nMy relationship with Persona Q is a very complicated one. There are many aspects of this game that I like, and just as many that left me both frustrated and disappointed. For those who are unaware, Persona Q was released for the 3ds back in 2014. While Persona spinoffs were nothing new at the time thanks to the Persona 4 arena games, what made Persona Q immediately stand out was the fact that this game was a full-fledged RPG featuring the casts of Persona 3 and Persona 4 in their prime. While the arena games gave us a taste of what these two casts teaming up would be like, Persona Q was intended to take this to a whole other level. You see, Persona Q is actually a crossover with another series developed by Atlus called Etrian Odyssey. A series of dungeon crawlers where the main appeal is the gigantic labyrinths you explore. I personally haven’t played these games outside of Persona Q, so I’m not sure which mechanics and design choices are from Etrian Odyssey or new ideas that were introduced or implemented here. \n\nI’m going to be judging this game solely as a Megami Tensei fan. This distinction is important because Persona Q is a very polarizing game for me. In order to explain why I’m going to have to go into a lot of detail, both in terms of story and mechanics. Not only are there going to be major spoilers for Persona Q in this video, but I’m also going to be assuming that you’ve played P3 and P4 for the sake of being able to reference specific scenes from those games in this video. So if you don’t want to be spoiled, please click off the video now. With that out of the way, let’s just dive right into it."

Yakuza 0 is the most popular game in the series and in this Yakuza 0 Review, I'm going to be reviewing Yakuza 0. There will be story spoilers in this Yakuza 0 Analysis but this is not a Yakuza 0 Story Explained. Yakuza 0 The Perfect Starting Point is just my own opinion on Yakuza 0. If you disagree with me, that's okay. This Yakuza 0 analysis is a stand-alone Yakuza 0 review. Yakuza 0 the perfect starting point is just the opinion of Nam's Compendium and doesn't represent the general public. So sit back and enjoy my Yakuza 0 Review.\n\nI’m pretty sure we all have one of those games that we’ve heard great things about but just never had the time to get into. For me personally, this would be the Yakuza series of video games. I’ve been somewhat familiar with the franchise for a while now thanks to word of mouth and some footage I’ve seen of the games online, but haven’t had the time to sink my teeth into any of these titles. That all changed however when I included Yakuza 0 in a poll I made to decide what game I’d cover next on the channel after receiving multiple requests to look at this series. To my surprise, the game ended up winning by a large margin. I’ve been wanting to try out these games for a while now and have been looking for an excuse to do so. But before I get right into it, there are a few things I need to say. \n\nPeople were wondering why I wanted to start off with Yakuza 0 instead of Yakuza Kiwami, which is a remake of the first game. This is for a few reasons. Yakuza 0 came out in Japan in 2015, with Kiwami being released the following year. While Kiwami’s plot is faithful to the PS2 original, there were extra scenes added that tie the game closer to Zero. There’s also the fact that the main combat mechanics in Kiwami are taken straight from Zero instead of the original Yakuza. For me personally, it only makes sense to start with the game that the remake attempts to tie into. a part of me feels obligated to play the PS2 Yakuza before I play Kiwami so I can have a better understanding of what was changed. Depending on how things turn out, I might even look at both titles in a future video. There’s also the fact that Yakuza 0 is a prequel set before the events of the first game, meaning that it’s a perfect jumping-off point. While I have no doubt that I’d get more out of the narrative if I’ve played the other games, it isn’t mandatory to understand what’s going on."

It was a great game in my opinion and is what I consider to be the best mainline installment. However, due to the low sales of Nocturne, it wouldn’t be until 2013 when we would finally get the next numbered installment. Shin Megami Tensei 4 was released for the Nintendo 3ds where it was met with high praise for both critics and fans alike. To this day it’s one of the most popular entries in the franchise and was a lot of people’s first exposure to mainline SMT, myself included. While I didn’t play the game at launch, I picked it up not too long after my first playthrough of Persona 5 back in 2017. I remember really enjoying myself and it acted as a gateway for me to experience the rest of what the series has to offer. But I will admit, it has been quite a few years since my last playthrough of this game, and with Shin Megami Tensei 5 just on the horizon, there’s no better time than now to take another look at SMT 4 and see if any of my thoughts have changed. There are going to be major spoilers throughout this video. I’m going to be discussing both the plot and the alignments in detail. So if you don’t want to be spoiled, then click off the video now and come back once you’ve played the game yourself. With that out of the way, let’s get started."

This will be an in-depth review of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake. The Final Fantasy 7 Remake is quite controversial in some areas, but I think that Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a great game that's worth your time. So in this Final Fantasy 7 Remake analysis, I'll explain to you why I enjoy the game as well as give a critique of the Final Fantasy 7 remake. I will also explain the story of the Final Fantasy 7 remake in detail, so there will be spoilers for the game.\n\nThe following video is going to be a full critique of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake. That means I will be going through almost everything the game has to offer, only skimming over some things that I don’t have a lot to say about. This video is coming from someone who never grew up with the original Final Fantasy 7 but has played it twice. Once last year, and a second time in preparation for this video. I have no nostalgia for the original game, but I respect it and the cultural impact surrounding it. This video will not be a direct comparison between the two games, but I will draw comparisons where I feel they are needed. \n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake[a] is an action role-playing game developed and published by Square Enix, released for PlayStation 4 on April 10, 2020. It is the first in a planned series of games remaking the 1997 PlayStation game Final Fantasy VII.\n\nSet in the dystopian cyberpunk metropolis of Midgar, players control mercenary Cloud Strife as he and an eco-terrorist group known as AVALANCHE oppose a powerful megacorporation known as Shinra from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines real-time action with strategic and role-playing elements.\n\nRemake was announced in 2015 following years of speculation. Several key staff members returned, including character designer Tetsuya Nomura as director and main character designer, director Yoshinori Kitase as producer, scenario writer Kazushige Nojima as story/scenario, event planner Motomu Toriyama as co-director/scenario design, and composer Nobuo Uematsu returning to compose the main theme of the game, among other staff. The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\nThe game was well received for its graphics, gameplay, narrative and music. It has become one of the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 games, selling over 3.5 million copies within the first three days."

        "description": "If you want my quick opinion on Resident Evil 8: Village, I’d say the game is really solid, well made, it’s fun, and certainly AAA quality. But, recommending is tricky. My first run on PC was about six hours. My subsequent runs on PS5 and Series X were even shorter at 5.5 hours and 4 hours respectively. Honestly, 6 hours is not much for a game I paid $70 for; I enjoyed it and felt it was a lean experience, but it doesn't change the fact that for that amount of money you can get A LOT more game. Not every game needs to be Persona 5 or Red Dead Redemption 2, but six hours is not much. Remember how much people freaked over The Order 1886’s length? Granted, you can get more out of repeated runs and more detailed runs where you collect all the doodads, upgrade the best weapons, and search every nook and cranny. That’s why this is all up your personal preference. While I’m ok with the price tag to length, considering the extremely high quality  of the game, I don’t have any issue if you aren’t ok with it. If you need more gameplay time then so be it. There is no issue there. In my mind it’s the same evaluation that takes place when somebody is looking at a cocktail menu. Some people are OK paying more for the same quantity just because it’s a higher quality, while others would much prefer to buy a fishbowl and get a lot of bang for their buck even if it’s of a low quality. Depending on your circumstances, goals, and preferences, both of these are valid options. So if you look at the six hours for $70 that you’ll get with resident evil eight and are repulsed we have no disagreement. I would say just wait for a sale and enjoy it then. If it’s any consolation, I really enjoyed my time with the game and it was one of the most high quality and the lean experiences I’ve had with a AAA title in the last year. But with that said let’s get into it.\n\nTIME STAMPS:\nIntro - 0:00\nGameplay - 9:13\nNarrative - 28:37\nConclusion - 1:27:10\n\nListen to Critiques on the go:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/luke-stephens-902962117\nLook up \"Luke Stephens\" on Apple Podcasts and Spotify!\n\n🐤 TWITTER: https://twitter.com/LukeStephensTV 🐤\n📷 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lukestephenstv/ 📷\n🎮 TWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/LukeStephensTV 🎮\n💵 Help fund the Show on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/LukeStephens 💵\n\nSend me something:\nLuke Stephens\nP.O.

Out of all the games I’ve covered for this channel so far, Persona 5 is by far the most requested one and for good reason too. When the game first launched back in late 2016 in Japan and April of 2017 for us western players, the game received overwhelming praise from both critics and fans alike. People were aware of Persona 4, everyone played Persona 5 when it came out. This combined with the inclusion of Persona 5’s protagonist, Joker, in the long-running Super Smash bros franchise, helped fully bring the Persona series into the mainstream. The momentum didn’t stop with that either. Much like Persona 4, P5 also received a handful of spinoff titles, a manga run, a bad anime, and multiple stage plays that I still really want to see."

However, a darker Hong Kong lurks just beneath the surface that sports violence, fear, and loss, and at the center of it all, is Wei Shen. Raised in old prosperity, Wei grew up with future members of the Hong Kong triads, most notably the Sun On Yee though, thoughdue to a sister who became addicted to drugs, Wei’s family decided the best course of action was to seek a better life in America. Years later, Wei, now a police officer, lands a job to go undercover with the Special Duties Unit to infiltrate the triads of Hong Kong. But I think we are getting a little ahead of ourselves here. Let’s instead take a look at how we got here.\n\n In 2002, developer LuxoFlux announced, as they described it, an action racing game inspired by popular action films for the Playstation 2 titled True Crime: Streets of L.A. True Crime LA released to mixed reviews but sold quite well. Starring a police officer investigating a sereis of bombings in Chinatown. The game sported racing, gunplay, and even multiple endings. It’s obviously a product of its time though, since most critics criticized it for it’s poor graphical fidelity and performance, and as it is an open world 3rd person action game, 101 comparisons to the Grand Theft Auto series were thrown its way. \n\n Just 3 years later we received True Crime: New York City. Being a separate story to the first entry in the True Crime series, it starred a New York gangster turned police officer, freshly promoted to the role of detective, who witnesses the death of his mentor, and he has to get to the bottom of it. Unfortunately True Crime New York received the same criticisms which highlighted the games many graphical blunders and some had theorized that the game was rushed to meet release windows. While many applauded it’s gameplay and the overall product, it sold poorly and was deemed a financial flop. This unfortunately led the games publisher, Activision, to put the series on hiatus, eventually handing the duty of creating the next entry, years later, to United Front Games. There were some *other* reasons as to why the project was scrapped but there are other videos that go into greater detail on that. United Front, based out of Vancouver Canada was a promising developer as they had already developed smash hits like... Mod Nation Racers, and nothing else. Regardless, they took an open world game that they were already developing and reworked it into True Crime Hong Kong.\n\n True Crime Hong Kong seemed very much like the other True Crime games though with added visual fidelity and a seemingly reworked combat system that took inspiration from the still recently released Batman Arkham Asylum. As a few years went by, we saw more and more gameplay trailers and there were a few immediate issues. The new antagonist Wei Shen looked quite generic and forgettable. The best way to describe this was that it looked as though you were just playing as an NPC, not an actual protagonist. Regardless, I’m sure Activision saw the same writing on the wall as a game following up the bomb that was True Crime New York was not likely to be a success. Other factors also lead to a loss in confidence as delays were frequent and the budget was getting tighter and tighter. With all that, Activision cancelled True Crime Hong Kong. \n\n\nSleeping Dogs was released in 2012 and now we have Sleeping Dogs 9 Years Later, A Sleeping Dogs Retrospective. This retrospective consists of The History of Sleeping Dogs, A Sleeping Dogs Critique, and a Sleeping Dogs Analysis. All of which is being done on Sleeping Dogs Definitive edition. Unlike the other Sleeping Dogs Review this Sleeping Dogs Definitive Edition Review encompasses the main game and the many DLC's included in the base game. This also functions as a Sleeping Dogs Ending Explained, as I recount the story as well. I also look at the future such as Sleeping Dogs Triad Wars, Sleeping Dogs 2, and any other Sleeping Dogs Sequel. Despite the word of Sleeping Dogs 2021 being thin, Sleeping Dogs Gameplay and the Sleeping Dogs Story Explained is truly worth playing and it is a worthy addition to True Crime Hong Kong, and the true crime series. This also functions as a True Crime Analysis, and any sleeping dogs developments."

Ratchet 3 is also my favorite game of all time.  BUT, that's not going to stop me from breaking the game down, digging deeper into its development than ever before, and exploring what Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal looked like during its production.  I've come out of this retrospective looking at this, my favorite game of all time, MUCH differently - and I think the same will happen to you, too!  This is Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal.\n\nThis is the most comprehensive retrospective and development documentary that's ever been produced about a Ratchet & Clank title, featuring never-before revealed information about Up Your Arsenal's development, including details on the game's cut space combat, interviews with and information sourced from former Insomniac employees that worked on Ratchet 3, and much more!\n\nWATCH NEXT: Ratchet: Deadlocked Retrospective https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHsramwwQfo\nRatchet & Clank's Crossovers in Other Games (feat.

        "description": "Parasite Eve may be the single most fascinating PS1 game to look back on today.  Thanks to its unique blend of horror and JRPG concepts, it's a game that hasn't been replicated in the 20 years since its release, not even by its own sequels.  As one of Square's first big titles following Final Fantasy VII, Parasite Eve's high production values led to its nickname - the first \"cinematic RPG\" - and it gave players a taste of what gaming would look like in the very near future.  And, on top of all of this, it's not even a unique franchise owned by Square Enix; Parasite Eve is a licensed game, the first video game that's a direct sequel to a novel!  In today's retrospective, we'll look back at one of the most unique games to ever grace the PlayStation, Square's Resident Evil RPG: Parasite Eve.\n\nSubscribe for more!  http://bit.ly/TGBSub\nSupport future videos!  http://www.patreon.com/TheGoldenBolt\nFollow me on Twitter!  http://www.twitter.com/TheGoldenBolt\n\nMore videos from The Golden Bolt:\nThe Legend of Dragoon Retrospective: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU7BaiMi78o\nMetroid: Other M - Death By Ambition: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEVPphRK7_o\n\n\n\"The Golden Bolt Theme\" composed by AllHailBuckets.

        "description": "Metroid: Other M has been vilified by fans and critics alike for its baffling story and design decisions for years, hailed as the game that killed the Metroid franchise.  And those fans are right - thanks to Other M's poor critical and sales performance, the Metroid series went dormant for years, and hasn't come close to recovering.  However, Other M is more than just \"the worst Metroid game,\" more than a character assassination of gaming's first female protagonist.  Other M's development tells tale of one man's obsessive aspirations; of a director who was dragged into a franchise he never wished to work on, for which he later became an adoptive father; of a team that wished to push the boundaries as a cinematic experience.  This Metroid: Other M retrospective will tell the tale of the failed game's development, through the eyes of those behind it, thanks to in-depth developer interviews from both before and since Other M's ill-fated release.  This is Metroid: Other M, a game killed by its ambition.\n\nSubscribe for more!  http://bit.ly/TGBSub\nSupport future videos!  http://www.patreon.com/TheGoldenBolt\nFollow me on Twitter!  http://www.twitter.com/TheGoldenBolt\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO:\nMykonosFan, Editor - https://www.youtube.com/MykonosFan\n\nFEATURING THE VOICES OF:\nTheCrazyEven as Ryuji Kitaura - https://www.youtube.com/thecrazyeven\nCreepy Elliot as Reggie Fils-Aime - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4m2clLA4ry0DQaObUc_DUQ\nPrimeHylian as Taiyo Aramaki - https://www.youtube.com/primehylian\nRayare Reviewing as Ryo Koike - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ5BIBlx2qwdkZbLh8ibU9Q\nSomecallmeJohnny as Yoshio Sakamoto - https://www.youtube.com/user/SomecallmeJohnny\nTokenGeek as Satoru Iwata - https://www.youtube.com/tokengeek\nThat Trav Guy as Yosuke Hayashi - https://www.youtube.com/user/IsomorphicFilms\n\nSOURCES/FURTHER READING:\n\nIwata Asks: Metroid: Other M (Part 1 - Nintendo): http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/metroid-other-m/0/0\nIwata Asks: Metroid: Other M (Part 2 - Team NINJA): http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/metroid-other-m/1/0  \nSuper Metroid Developer Interview: https://www.nintendo.com/super-nes-classic/interview-super-metroid/\nMetroid Developer Interview: https://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/metroid-developer-interview/\nMetroid: Other M - Yoshio Sakamoto Interview (GameSpot): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up8GLJ0aVVo\n\"Nintendo Trying to Figure Out What Went Wrong With Newest Metroid\" (Kotaku): https://kotaku.com/nintendo-trying-to-figure-out-what-went-wrong-with-newe-5688617\n\"Nintendo's Reggie Talks Metroid, Amiibo, And (Of Course) Mother 3: (Kotaku): https://kotaku.com/nintendos-reggie-talks-metroid-amiibo-and-of-course-1713347550\n\"Interview: Metroid Co-Creator Details Fusion Remake Pitch, Skipping Switch and Series' Future\" (GameRant): https://gamerant.com/metroid-samus-returns-producer-yoshi-sakamoto-interview/\nMetroid: Other M - The Challenge of Project M (Part 1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHPZSrG4AXY\nMetroid: Other M - The Challenge of Project M (Part 2): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zPkFzMR_9k\nYoshio Sakamoto Interview (NintendoWorldReport): https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/translation/23982/yoshio-sakamoto-interview\n\"Grab Metroid Other M for $6.99 at GameStop\" (My Nintendo News): https://mynintendonews.com/2011/12/17/grab-metroid-other-m-for-6-99-at-gamestop/\n\"Metroid Other M Finally Sells Over One Million\" (My Nintendo News): https://mynintendonews.com/2012/01/07/metroid-other-m-finally-sells-over-one-million/\n\n\"The Golden Bolt Theme\" composed by AllHailBuckets.

Sometimes hailed as a \"Final Fantasy Killer\" before release, Legend of Dragoon received a middling reception by critics and is still an incredibly divisive game online.   What is it that led to Legend of Dragoon being so beloved by many, and so maligned by others?  Today in this 20th Anniversary Retrospective, I'll break down why Legend of Dragoon was the game that made me fall in love with JRPGs, and why those that hate the game are probably right too!\n\nSpecial thanks to @MykonosFan for his editing assistance!

Even though I don't think the original is a bad game, it has many problems that it suffers from, most notably a lack of focus and direction. Have any of them been addressed for Sonic Adventure 2? Which of the two titles do I feel is better? I hope this lengthy video provides all the details."

Sonic 2006 was one of the earliest games to be released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3; one that was intended to clean up the Blue Blur's image, but through an unfortunate series of events ended up accomplishing the exact opposite. The game is not only considered by many to be the worst entry in the franchise, but one of the worst video games ever published. Does Sonic 2006 deserve to be called the latter? I originally intended to fully cover the game under thirty minutes, but after mulitple attempts at revising the script to reach that goal, I felt important details were getting scrapped. What needs to be said needs to be said."

A new Mega Man game would be released every single year, but many people grew tired of the Blue Bomber around the 4th and 5th installments, with dropping sales figures as a result. Because of this, series artist Keiji Infaune wanted to re-invent the Mega Man formula through new gameplay features and a more mature storyline. Not to be confused with 2010's Mega Man 10, the outcome was Mega Man X for the 16-bit Super Nintendo in 1993: a spin-off of sorts that spawned a whole slew of fresh and different Mega Man experiences. Reboots don't always go too well with people, but Mega Man X is actually loved by many, performed remarkably well with critics and sold over a million copies, so the developers clearly must have done something right. This review will further elaborate on that, and whenever there's a remake or port available of a game, I will always include that, as well. For Mega Man X we have the 2005 remake Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X for the PlayStation Portable, which generally doesn't seem to be appreciated by fans. However, I will give it the full review treatment that it rightfully deserves.\n-----\nWriting, editing & narrating: Michael Hardeman\nGame creation: Capcom\n\nMega Man © Capcom\nSonic the Hedgehog © Sega\n\nAll music & imagery © to their respective owners"

When these titles were still fresh, both had been very well-received by critics as well as loyal Sega and Sonic followers, comfortably sneaking over the 80% mark if GameRankings is anything to go by, and the community love for the Adventure games has been very evident since their releases. Due to the cancellation of the Sega Dreamcast in early 2001 and the company's retirement from the console hardware business, future games would have to be developed for the competing sixth generation consoles: the Sony PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube and the Microsoft Xbox. It took Sonic Team over two years, but in December of 2003, the first multi-platform Sonic title came out in Japan: Sonic Heroes. Intended to celebrate the twelfth anniversary of the franchise and created to appeal to more casual players, initial reviews for Sonic Heroes were noticeably less favorable than the ones for its 3D predecessors, with averages ranging from 64% for the PlayStation 2 port, to 73% for the Xbox version. 73% isn't too bad of a score, but for as long as I can remember, Sonic Heroes has generally been seen as the start of the series' downfall and a good amount of fans will argue it's a horrible to mediocre installment, failing to meet the quality standards of the Adventure games. Is the game deserving of all this flack in my eyes? Grab some drinks and snacks because you're in for a long ride to hear my full thoughts.\n-----\nWriting, editing & narrating: Michael Hardeman\nGame creation: Sonic Team\nMultiplayer assistance: ''Rick FM''\n\nSonic the Hedgehog © Sega\nRatchet & Clank © Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nAll music & imagery © to their respective owners"

To me it seemed to be a smoother, better-crafted experience, mainly because it isn't as arbitrarily difficulty as its predecessor, though the music isn't nearly as memorable and the weapons are disappointing. That said, while X2 didn't get the same amount of loving attention as X1, it performed well enough for Capcom to start developing the third title, so after another twelve months, Mega Man X3 was released for the Super Nintendo on December 1st, 1995. Some critics gave X3 a positive review, praising it as a solid send-off for the 16-bit era, but others had grown tired of the formula, complaining it's the same game yet again, or even noted sluggish and sloppy design overall. Because the Super Nintendo was slowly but surely losing popularity with the then-recent rise of fifth generation consoles, ports of the game for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn, boasting anime-esque FMV cutscenes and a re-arranged Red Book Audio soundtrack, came out on April 26th, 1996. This 32-bit version got even more flack than the original, with one source calling Mega Man X3 the worst Saturn title out there. Even fans of the franchise generally consider this swan-song of the SNES trilogy, not necessarily a bad game, but inferior to the previous installments from what I've gathered, so could it be that Capcom was losing it already with the third X game?\n-----\nWriting, editing & narrating: Michael Hardeman\nGame creation: Capcom\n\nMega Man © Capcom\nSonic the Hedgehog © Sega\n\nAll music & imagery © to their respective owners"

Since Sonic games were and are largely targeted toward younger audiences, director Takashi Iizuka desired to catch the attention of an older audience for once. Logically so because, at the time, the industry had largely shifted from cartoony and child-friendly games, to mature, edgy and deep games more and more. Series producer Yuji Naka stated in an interview that Shadow the Hedgehog was chosen as the starring character for this new game due to his popularity amongst fans, and the addition of darker story elements, vehicles and weapons would have made it an inappropriate act to label it a Sonic game, and then sell it as such. The concept was seen as ridiculous when people witnessed the first trailers in early 2005 and they had no idea how it was all going to play out. Later down the year in the holiday season, Shadow the Hedgehog came out for the Nintendo GameCube, Sony PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Xbox for them to find out. Critically the game wasn't liked with the PS2 version averaging the lowest at 45% on Metacritic and the GameCube version averaging the highest at 51%. Review scores aren't everything, but with those numbers, Shadow the Hedgehog was viewed as the low-point of the entire main Sonic line-up until Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 came along. To this day, however, there are fans who will argue it is in fact inferior to Sonic 2006… If that doesn’t speak volumes, then I haven’t got a monkey’s what does. All I knew was that I played Shadow the Hedgehog back when I was a kid and got every single A rank, so I must've seen something in it. Does the same apply at my age of 19 now? Well, I'll do my very best to provide a fair look in this video at Shadow the Hedgehog.\n-----\nWriting, narrating & editing: Michael Hardeman\nLogo designs: ''RomyvdHel'', Specter Salmon & ''Ollie''\nGame creation: Sonic Team\n\nShadow the Hedgehog © Sega\nAll audio & imagery © to their respective owners"

The number of settings that they can appear in are unlimited. The range of powers and attributes that they can possess are vast. And because they lack a pulse, the ramifications of killing them are nonexistent. When Nathan Drake murders hundreds of mercenaries in Uncharted, one can’t help but wonder whether he is truly a good person. But when Leon Kennedy does the same to the undead in Resident Evil, there’s no question as to Leon’s righteousness. \n\n The only major downside to zombies is that because of this versatility, there are no shortage of games that feature them – and because there are no shortage of games that feature them, their presence alone is rarely enough to make whatever they’re part of feel special. Few games from the mid-2000s were more acutely aware of this than Dead Rising. The brainchild of Capcom’s Keiji Inafune, Dead Rising cast players in the role of Frank West, a photojournalist-turned-vigilante who tasks himself with discovering the scoop of a lifetime in a zombie-infested shopping mall. While many players picked it up because of this premise alone, most stayed with it when they discovered that underneath laid a challenging, yet deeply rewarding gameplay experience; one that exacerbated the danger of its zombies with a stringent time limit, and an unforgiving save system.\n\n When the dust around its release settled, the industry had crowned it one of the most unique takes on the genre, and a solid demonstration of how the seventh console generation would be able to take the medium to new heights. Yet Capcom was dissatisfied. It felt that Dead Rising could have been better had it leaned more deeply into its Western design elements, and that its development team had been unable to do so because it was almost entirely Japanese.\nAs a result, the company would enlist Vancouver-based developer Blue Castle Games to take over the series in its stead – a decision that helped improve it in the short term, yet stripped it of everything that made it unique in the long term.\n\nThis is the rise and fall of Dead Rising.\n\nCHAPTERS\n00:00 Intro\n2:20 Dead Rising\n15:24 Dead Rising 2\n26:18 Dead Rising 3\n33:38 Dead Rising 4\n39:32 Outro\n\nSupport the channel by becoming a member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/GVMERS/join\n\nSubscribe to GVMERS:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=GVMERS\n\nFollow GVMERS on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/GVMERS_\n\nLike GVMERS on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GVMERS\n\nJoin the GVMERS Discord channel:\nhttps://discord.gg/sZApcwx\n\nSubscribe to the GVMERS subreddit: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GVMERS/"

Spawning a number of sequels that have both surpassed and foiled fans' expectations there is no question that Batman and superheroes in general in the video game medium have seen a new lease on life and many would argue that this is due to the smash success of Batman Arkham Asylum. With a simplistic story of the Joker taking over a mental institution for the criminally insane, with complex narratives just under the surface, gameplay that while primitive is still as addicting as ever, and a presentation that still holds up to this day, Batman Arkham Asylum is a cornerstone in modern gaming and it’s sequels have to varying degrees added to this legacy. \n\n Now as I’m sure a majority of you have seen, I have talked about nearly every Arkham game, barring Arkham VR, which is just too short for me to say anything on. Included in the list of Arkham games I’ve talked about, is Arkham Asylum, which may confuse some of you. No, I’m not running out of ideas, the reason I’m talking about this game again is simply because, when I did initially talk about this game I was very new to that style of video and as such, it wasn’t very good. By the time I got to the other Arkham games I had a better idea of how to make these bad boys and while they are by no means perfect now, I think there is a noticeable quality gap between my Arkham Asylum video and the rest of my Arkham videos. Most notably is that I did more to just describe the game than I did to actually give my thoughts on it, hency why I felt it was necessary to actually take a deeper look at it here. So with that being said let’s actually take a look at Batman Arkham Asylum. And of course, like with all my other videos, this isn’t an objective statement of the games quality and I don’t believe that my opinion is fact and I’d like to encourage friendly discussion about the game. If you disagree with some points, let me know why, we could probably both learn something from it. \n\n\n\nBatman Arkham Asylum: A Horrifying Masterpiece by That Boy Aqua\n\nThe Introductions: 0:00\nThe Asylum: 3:44\nThe Batman: 11:55 \nThe Villains: 27:59\nThe Spirit: 35:07\nThe Result: 42:17\nPost Script: 44:33\n\nIt only makes sense that a game like this be compared to other video games even to this day as it served as such an influence on gaming as a whole. Arkham Asylum laid the groundwork for one of the most popular and arguably best Triple A series as of writing this video, with fans still wanting more. And that’s why I believe it is an isolated, expertly crafted, nostalgic, horrifying, masterpiece.\n\nBatman Arkham is one of the most prominent triple A games out right now, sporting Batman Arkham Asylum, Batman Arkham City, Batman Arkham Knight. This is unfortunately the final That Boy Aqua Batman batman video but at least we are ending it on a Batman Arkham Asylum Critique. In this Batman Arkham Asylum Analysis we will look at Batman Arkham Asylum Gameplay, story, and presentation the same that I have in my, Batman Arkham City Critique, Batman Arkham Knight Critique, and my Batman Arkham Origins Critique. I truly believe this game is A Horrifying Masterpiece, and may be one of the Best Arkham Game. This is an Arkham Asylum Critique and is a little more in depth than my previous Arkham Asylum Review. If you have not played the game I suggest you buy it or search up an Arkham Asylum Walkthrough or an Arkham Asylum Explained video. This video concludes the That Boy Aqua Batman Arkham series and Arkham Retrospective."

FFII's soundtrack is really good, but i definitely had to nick some other songs for the sake of having music that fit what i was talking about. \n\nfootage used throughout the video:\n- FFX sphere grid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq8ffw3Y2N4\n- Takeshi's Castle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu0MZqq5phE\nthe rest of the footage was captured by me. but please check out the above videos and their creators! \n\nfinally, a huge thanks to my best pal Joe, without whom this channel would be much worse off.

        "description": "https://patreon.com/ludiscere\nhttps://twitter.com/ludiscere\n\nhey everyone, welcome back to another video. this time round we’re taking a proper deep dive into the masterpiece that is Hades - however, rather than looking at this like a review, or a stereotypical analysis, we’re going to be checking out the mythology that inspired the game, and seeing how closely what you’ll find in Hades matches up with pre-established Greek myth. there are timestamps below for your convenience.\n\nhere are the timestamps:\n\nIntroduction + Thesis: 00:00\nHades: 3:25\nNyx: 12:36\nZagreus: 18:59\nCharon: 24:49\nHypnos + Thanatos: 30:16 \nThe Furies: 37:17\nChaos: 46:28\nZeus: 51:34\nPoseidon: 57:05\nAthena: 1:04:16\nAphrodite: 1:10:36\nArtemis: 1:16:41\nAres: 1:23:32\nDionysus: 1:30:56   \nHermes: 1:38:00\nDemeter: 1:44:14\nAchilles + Patroclus: 1:49:21\nOrpheus + Eurydice: 1:57:08\nSisyphus: 2:06:37\nTheseus + Asterius: 2:13:56\nCerberus: 2:23:35\nDusa: 2:30:56\nSkelly: 2:35:54\nPersephone: 2:44:02\nHouse of Hades: 2:50:31\nThe Underworld: 2:51:49\nTartarus + Asphodel + Elysium: 2:54:57\nErebus: 3:00:44\nGreece: 3:03:35\nStygius: 3:06:17\nVaratha: 3:11:38\nCoronacht: 3:15:53 \nAegis: 3:18:48\nMalphon: 3:21:38\nExagryph: 3:25:14\nConclusion + Thanks: 3:31:38\n\nand here is a list of stuff i bring up in the video that i say you can find more info about in the description:\n\n- the excellent Noclip documentaries about Hades: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-THgg8QnvU4JEVov1tMlFThNYS92F8uC\n- Supergiant's PAX West panel: - https://youtube.com/watch?v=PqiTG-j_tT4\n- a link to enecola's twitter and instagram (she did the amazing Zeus/Nyx/Hypnos art, please show her some love!): https://twitter.com/enecola and https://instagram.com/enecola.art\n- Dr Emily Wilson's twitter thread on misogyny in translation: https://twitter.com/EmilyRCWilson/status/971823035664818176\n- a link to Viria's twitter and instagram accounts, give her a follow if you want to see more amazing art: https://twitter.com/viria13 and https://instagram.com/viria94\n- Giulia Sissa's piece on virginity in the ancient world: https://eugesta-revue.univ-lille.fr/pdf/2013/Sissa-3_2013.pdf\n- the book from which i got the caduceus/asclepius survey info: https://worldcat.org/title/golden-wand-of-medicine-a-history-of-the-caduceus-symbol-in-medicine/oclc/24246627\n- the reddit thread about Eurydice that Greg Kasavin responded to: https://reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/ef87fv/eurydice_isnt_a_tree_nymph\n- the Beowulf translation i used: https://bloggersbeowulf.com/2018/08/09/beowulf-boasts-the-dragon-roasts-book-xxxiv-book-xxxv/\n- the book referring to Enkidu being part-bull: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PyJZyabg7OsC&pg=PA15&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nworth noting that i made a mistake in the Chaos section - i switch between the they/them and he/him pronouns, when they were all meant to be they/them. sorry about this, it's a blunder i'm pretty annoyed i've made. my intention was to use they/them the whole time, but it was just a slip of the tongue. my bad.\n\nall the footage in the game was captured by me! it took a while, unsurprisingly.\n\ni'd like to say a huge thanks to my best pal Joe, without whom this channel would be much worse off. Joe has done all the art for my channel from its inception, from the old logo to the new black mage logo, the old intro and all the outros, and most recently the incredible art for my Patreon tiers! he is an immensely talented artist and an absolute legend so check him out:\nhttps://twitter.com/SteakJoe\nhttps://instagram.com/steakjoeart\n\ni’d also really like to thank HotCyder for his excellent work on the thumbnail! if you want to check him out, you can find him on both YouTube and Twitter:\nhttps://youtube.com/user/HotCyderable\nhttps://twitter.com/HotCyder\n\ni think that's it! thanks everyone. hope you enjoy the video :)\n\n- alastair x\n\n#Hades #GreekMythology #Supergiant"

This is a multipart video series just stitched together, and I apologize for the audio quality of the first couple of videos: I got a better setup for the later parts. Unfortunately there's some hitching during scenes caused by dropped frames during recording thanks to Gamebryo being 13 years old and Davinci Resolve having no idea what to do with those missing frames after rendering the videos twice. If the hitching is too obnoxious, the original videos are much smoother and can be found in the playlist here: https://rb.gy/wxoehn\n\n-SOCIALS-\n♻️Discord: https://discord.gg/5pr3Nx3ZMd\n🐧Twitter: https://twitter.com/PSessionsYT\n🎥Stream Archives: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiScHlsGure-kyCxA08bwCaTzSYbuWbz5\n#Retrospective #Analysis #Review #Long #Privatesessions\n\nMusic Tracks:\nhttps://rb.gy/vqfaxb\n\nPart 1 - The Gameplay\n0:00 - Part 1 Intro\n2:26 - Combat and Mechanics\n19:30 - Skills and Leveling\n44:15 - Part 1 Outro\n\nPart 2 - The World\n45:46 - Part 2 Intro\n47:07 - The Graphics\n51:46 - The Sound & Music\n58:05 - The Controls\n1:03:31 - The History of Cyrodiil\n1:08:51 - The People of Cyrodiil\n1:14:21 - The Places of Cyrodiil\n1:33:03 - The Exploration\n\nPart 3 - The Quests i\n1:47:56 - Part 3 Intro\n1:49:31 - The Main Story\n2:20:17 - The Mage's Guild\n2:51:11 - The Fighter's Guild\n2:59:07 - The Thieves Guild\n\nPart 4 - The Quests ii\n3:36:29 - Part 4 Intro\n3:36:49 - The Dark Brotherhood\n4:29:06 - The Daedric Shrines\n4:45:02 - The Side Quests\n\nPart 5 - The Shivering Isles\n4:57:15 - Part 5 Intro\n4:57:57 - The Gatekeeper\n5:07:33 - The New Arrival\n5:20:15 - The Good, the Bad, and the Crazy\n5:32:17 - The Other Shade of Crazy\n5:37:42 - The Madgod's Protégé\n5:51:54 - The Successor \n6:04:40 - The New Lord of Madness\n6:08:55 - The Other DLC\n\nPart 6 - The Conclusion\n6:16:37 - Part 6 Intro\n6:19:48 - The Constant Contradictions\n6:34:27 - The Defense of Jank"

It also discusses how Campbell's monomyth influenced the philosophies of the Jedi and Sith more than George Lucas might care to admit.

        "description": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been one of the most influential, impactful video games released in recent years. A Breath of the Wild review or retrospective like this can be a bit of a delicate subject considering the passionate reception it's received, in communities ranging from casual Nintendo fans to the speedrunning world, but fair warning: this video isn't very delicate. It unflinchingly breaks the game apart to see where Nintendo succeeds, as well as fails, with hopes that some of its (numerous) issues can be addressed in Breath of the Wild 2. The original intention behind this video was to be released back in February, alongside the Zelda news we were undoubtedly going to be getting for the series' 35th anniversary...right? Welp, unless you really love Skyward Sword HD for $60, I think it's fair to say the lack of a Breath of the Wild sequel announcement took the wind out of a lot of peoples' sails anyways, so in retrospect, the date of this video panned out just fine. \"Breath of the Wild - A Hearty Retrospective\" marks my first step into the long form game review format, so please let me know your thoughts on what went right and wrong, and enjoy!\n\n______________________________________________\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MrMockRock​\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/mockrock\n\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/mockrocktwitch​\n\nBusiness email: MockRock@inf1uence.com\n\nTeespring: teespring.com/stores/mockrock\n\n______________________________________________\n\nMusic used:\n\nMisc.

Caddicarus is FINALLY back in the first Caddicarus episode of 2021. I know it’s April, but as many of you already know, my PC problems have been unbelievable all year. So what better way to come back than with some of the worst games ever made? More specifically - worst Kinect games ever made? From Harry Potter to Star Wars and Sonic the Hedgehog to Steel Battalion - yes - we’re going to be going through a dumpload of Microsoft Kinect games for the Xbox 360, and looking at some of the worst Kinect games of all time. Which is weird, since despite all of the Kinect E3 cringe and Kinect reveal during the Project Natal release - and all of the lies surrounding Project Milo, Star Wars, Kinectimals and SO much more - the Kinect technology became a huge success for Microsoft, and is being continued to this day with Xbox One systems - even though the Xbox One reveal with always-on Kinect was one of the worst things Microsoft ever did. You’ve all seen the Crowbcat Kinect video, it’s called the dark age of Xbox for a reason.There may be some gems in there such as The Gunstringer review with Gunstringer gameplay and even the Kinect Sports review and Kinect Adventures review with Kinect Sports gameplay and Kinect Adventures gameplay - but then we have the other Xbox 360 Kinect games. Kinect Star Wars review with Kinect Star Wars gameplay. Kinect Disneyland Adventures review with Disneyland gameplay. Kinect Harry Potter review with Harry Potter Kinect gameplay. Sonic Free Riders review with Sonic Free Riders gameplay. Rise of Nightmares review with Rise of Nightmares gameplay. Hulk Hogan’s Main Event. Raving Rabbids. Toy Story Mania. Star Wars Kinect. Oh wait, I already said that one. JonTron did that one already, right? Anyway, don’t expect to see any walkthrough or guide especially for the more linear adventures like Rise of Nightmares - and don’t expect an Angry Joe rant with Angry Joe Kinect review videos - this is me, this is 17 Xbox games using awful motion controls, and all we have left is Galactic Dance Off.

        "description": "Xenoblade Chronicles (2010) was a masterclass Japanese Role-Playing Game (JRPG), released on the Nintendo Wii. It took several years for the game to receive an official English localization. Xenoblade Chronicles is a part of the larger Xeno series, pioneered by Testuya Takahashi, that features Xenogears and all the Xenosaga games. The game takes place on the backs of two frozen titans, who struck each other down in a legendary battle eons ago. The story of Xenoblade depicts the struggle between the Mechon, a bloodthirsty race of autonomous machines, and the Homs, a species of humanoid beings.\n\nThis video is an in-depth Xenoblade Chronicles critique. In it, I'll be examining everything about the game--the story, characters, music, level design, etc. This video can serve as both a review/critique/analysis/retrospective of Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii and its release on the Switch--Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition (DE). Below, you can find timestamps for each section in the video, allowing you to watch the critique in small, digestible chunks.\n\nScript: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gwo7aXI92TpfbsYVGaQfmE_-hYvdNElYPkuUR6pJJbQ/edit?usp=sharing\n\nBefore you read any further, MAJOR SPOILERS WILL FOLLOW!

Now a Nintendo Switch Exclusive and in the hands of developer Team Ninja, the experience is quite a bit different from the prior 2 games. In this video, we'll go back and look at every aspect of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3. For example, we'll discuss initial fan reactions to the announcement trailer and how the game was received after release. We'll also take a very in-depth walk through the storyline of MUA3, the dlc, all the additional content, and how the game compares to the prior ones. Basically, we're talking about everything! Btw, this is a SPOILER FILLED retrospective review of the game, so make sure you've beaten the story before watching.  We have a ton to discuss, so I hope you'll join me in revisiting Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 :)\n\nAlways Nerdy is a Youtube channel dedicated to all things nerdy and Marvel, with a focus on Marvel Gaming properties such as Marvel's Avengers and the Marvel Ultimate Alliance series.

        "description": "A perfect sequel is a game that improves on essentially everything from the first game. It expands the story told in the first game, expands the gameplay, and ideally sees some refined graphical fidelity. Now, a perfect sequel is not a perfect game in my eyes. I don’t think InFAMOUS 2 is a perfect game, a really good game, hell yea, but not a perfect one. With that being said it improves on almost everything from the first game and that in my eyes makes it damn close to the perfect sequel. Now if you have not seen my video on InFAMOUS 1, I highly recommend that you take a look at that as it explains what I liked and didn’t like but I can very briefly give a recap here.\n\n\nThat Boy Aqua Live: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEowSauQP2j_1fYR7BHeFMA\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBoyAqua​\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thatboyaqua​\n\nChannel Memberships: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwKY6YKl0-amtFsfYEDpMkA/join\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/VBJwTUa​\n\nAll music created exclusively by 444aidan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnsQizvIUJs9bAdEFd2iLew\n\n - Chapters - \nIntro: 0:00\nVoices & Sound: 3:49\nGraphics & Performance: 4:51\nMap Design: 8:44\nTraversal: 14:32\nCombat & Powers: 17:00\nMission Design: 25:59\nBosses & Mini Bosses: 31:49\nSide Quests: 38:21\nKarma: 38:43\nStory Summary & Analysis: 47:32\nCharacter Analysis: 55:18\nConclusion: 1:01:18\nPost Script: 1:03:42\n\n Essentially, InFAMOUS 1 was a really ambitious game and as I argued in my video on it, too ambitious for its own good. The map seemed to be too large for the traversal abilities to keep up with and it was even too large for the console to keep up with. Textures were often muddy and popin was almost as numerous as the major frame rate drops which would often tank into the single digits. Those same textures also just had a very muddy colour scheme that made Empire city a bit of an eye sore at times. The story was pretty interesting and despite being relatively simple on the surface, had a ton of lore that kept me engaged despite it being a little cheesy, which again, I didn’t mind. The traversal was a little too primitive for me and there were too many skyscrapers with little ways to scale them effectively. Mission design was fun in some cases but often felt like padding. The morality system did a good job of justifying both the good and evil options and your choices actually made a reasonable difference. The combat was a little too difficult for my taste but not in a good way. I found too many enemies just flat out one shotted you and these same enemies had the ability to go invisible. Boss fights were often just okay and they unfortunately were pretty unremarkable aside from the spectacle alone. \n\n Fortunately InFAMOUS 2 in my eyes has a better story, better characters, a better world, better gameplay, and better graphical fidelity than its ancestor and I’m going to try and explain why I feel that way throughout this video.\n\n Before we go any further I have to clarify that I will be spoiling everything from both InFAMOUS 1 and 2. \n\n Now with that being said, just about everything in InFAMOUS one both good and bad, was improved upon or expanded upon here in InFAMOUS 2. InFAMOUS 1 stars Cole McGrath, a courier that ends up gaining the power to control electricity after a package he is delivering, which is a radioactive bomb called the ray sphere, detonates. Cole was not the only one who had powers activated by the ray sphere and his goal is to stop those who are using their powers for evil. He gains a reputation as a hero and after defeating a mysterious figure named Kessler, he prepares for an abominable foe, named the beast. Now, there is also an Evil route but the Good ending is canon. Now for a more in depth summary and analysis please refer to my InFAMOUS 1 video. \n\n\n\n\ninfamous 2 is almost a perfect sequel,here's why.\n\nin this infamous 2 review, infamous 2 critique, infamous 2 gameplay, or infamous 2 analysis. We look at the second game in our infamous series retrospective and infamous series analysis. in this video we will discuss the infamous 2 ending theory and try to present an infamous 2 explained type of video. We will also look at the infamous 2 karma. If you want to see more you can find my infamous second son critique, my infamous 11 years later, and my infamous 2 13 years later. I knew that you guys wanted this video because one of the most popular searches on my channel is that boy aqua infamous 2. I hope we get an infamous remastered or infamous ps5. Next on the list is infamous festival of blood. You can also refer to this video for the infamous 2 good ending and. infamous 2 bad ending"

That video has now been delisted in favor of this updated, tidier edition. A link to it has been provided below for anyone still curious, as well as download links for mods.

The first InFamous came out and it was really good and I think you guys can all agree with that. Then the second InFamous came out and it improved on everything from the original despite still having some glaring issues. The InFamous games were some of the best games on the Playstation 3 and are still must play titles to this day. With the next generation consoles coming around the corner it was important to have a real console seller out of the gate and sony’s answer to this was InFamous Second Son. Unfortunately this game as far as I have seen has left the fanbase very divided with a lot of people saying things like the powers are underdeveloped the gameplay isn't as fun as previous games and that the characters aren't very good. I however disagree. I think it's time somebody took more of a positive approach to this game to hopefully make you see it from a different perspective. I want to clarify that I am a little biased here because this is easily my favourite game of all time being rivaled only by Spiderman PS4 and Persona 5.\n\n\n\n\n\ninFAMOUS Second Son, a PlayStation 4 exclusive , brings you an action adventure game where surrounded by a society that fears them, superhumans are ruthlessly hunted down and caged by the Department of Unified Protection. Step into a locked-down Seattle as Delsin Rowe, who has recently discovered his superhuman power and is now capable of fighting back against the oppressive DUP. Enjoy your power as you choose how you will push your awesome abilities to the limit and witness the consequences of your actions as they affect the city and people around you.\n\nInfamous: Second Son (stylized as inFAMOUS: SECOND SON) is the third main installment in the InFAMOUS series and is a PlayStation 4 exclusive. It features a new setting, a new protagonist, a totalitarian government controlled by propaganda, and a new antagonist, the D.U.P. (Department of Unified Protection). It is set seven years after the end of Cole MacGrath's story and stars a new protagonist, Delsin Rowe.\n\nInFamous: Second Son was first announced at Sony's PlayStation 4 Press Conference on February 20, 2013, after officially announcing the successor to the PlayStation 3.\n\nAs in inFamous and inFamous 2, Karmic choices plays a role in the main story. The protagonist, Delsin Rowe, has the ability to absorb other Conduits' powers, replacing the electric-based powers of Cole MacGrath from Infamous and Infamous 2 with multiple others. Every power that Delsin gets drastically changes the way the game is played. Over the course of the entire game, Delsin gains access to new abilities by allying with other Conduits and absorbing their powers. By the end of the game, Delsin has absorbed the powers of four Conduits, and thus has access to four different powers. While Delsin can have access to only one of his powers at a time, he can easily switch by absorbing the corresponding power source.\n\nFor the first time in the series, the player will be able to shoot without having to aim beforehand (although it is still an option) to instill a sense a fluidity and quickness in gameplay.\n\nDestruction has been greatly improved from the past games. More objects can now be destroyed and will stay destroyed for the rest of the game, unlike in previous inFamous titles.\n\nWelcome to an analysis where I analyze inFAMOUS Second Son. In defense of inFAMOUS Second Son is a video discussing and critiquing the pros and cons of the game through this review of inFAMOUS Second Son. This is not an inFAMOUS retrospective or a comparison but rather an inFAMOUS Second Son critique. This video titled In Defense of inFAMOUS Second Son was created by Aqua or That_Boy_Aqua. \n\nVideo by: Aqua, Aqua, That_Boy_Aqua Aqua, Aqua Review, Aqua Game\n\nOther games I've covered include Assassins Creed Unity, Assassins Creed Syndicate, and Watch_Dogs 2.\n\nMaybe there will be an inFAMOUS game for the Playstation 5?\n\ninFAMOUS Second Son.\n\nI know its bad."

All the thoughts in this video are purely my opinion so if you disagree that's ok. I'm open to having discussions with you guys as long as it stays civil. I hope you guys enjoy this video and thanks so much for 19K subscribers. It's wild.\n\n\n\nThe following is a brief summary of the game.\n\nAssassin's Creed: Odyssey is the eleventh main installment in the Assassin's Creed series developed by Ubisoft. The game was primarily developed by Ubisoft Québec, which had previously worked on Assassin's Creed: Syndicate. The concept for the game emerged in 2015, as the team was wrapping up development on Syndicate. In the shift to an RPG-esque game, inspiration was taken from titles such as The Witcher 3, Fallout, and The Elder Scrolls, in regards to the idea of player choice. The development team engaged in communication with the team behind Assassin's Creed: Origins; it was decided to quote: \"push [the series] forward\" with the introduction of RPG elements. The setting of ancient Greece was chosen as it was one of the most requested settings from the fanbase.\n\nOdyssey uses a lot of the same graphics technology as Origins. Far more colour was used in the game; the designers tried to tap into the notion that the ancient Greeks believed that their land was built by the gods, thus the use of vibrant colours. There was pushback against the \"ordinary\" depictions of ancient Greece, which lean on it being an arid place with an emphasis on white and gold. The end result is intended to be a middle-ground between historical accuracy and vibrancy.\n\nThe game's genetic memory story is set in 431 BCE, recounting the secret history of the Peloponnesian War, fought between the city-states of ancient Greece. The protagonist is a mercenary named either Alexios or Kassandra who can choose to fight for either Athens and the Delian League or Sparta and the Peloponnesian League, as well as against the Cult of Kosmos. The modern-day segments will again follow Layla Hassan, who was first introduced in Assassin's Creed Origins, and her story will touch on the Isu.\n\nOdyssey uses a lot of the gameplay and interface mechanics of Origins, including the radial compass, and the return of a bird that can survey the landscape, spot treasure, and highlight and harass enemies.\n\nThe game features RPG elements, including dialogue options, branching quests, multiple possible endings, romance options, and the ability to select between a male or female protagonist. Reportedly, the game is a \"full RPG,\" and will push the franchise into this genre. Both Alexios and Kassandra follow the same story. Romance options remain the same regardless of the character chosen. Interactions with NPCs can have consequences, either short or long term, in regards to the story. Choices are said to \"add up.\" Relationships with NPCs don't always change, and there is no binary divide in regards to interaction—lying to an NPC isn't necessarily a \"bad\" choice, and vice versa. By extension, there is no \"right\" way to play the game in regards to character choice.\n\nGear can be selected, and is classified by rarity. Each piece of gear can be enhanced with engravings. Players also have access to a skill tree, and can follow a 'branch' to better suit their playstyle. Compared to Origins, the skill tree is more clear cut in Odyssey, and players can unlock high tier versions of pre-existing skills. In combat, the hitbox system for enemies is used again.\n\nThe game world has been described as the \"biggest one yet\" for the franchise; specifically, the game map is 100 square miles, split evenly between land and sea. Environments range from forests to mountains, to beaches. \"Legendary animals\" can be hunted on land. The world is divided into the number of zones divided by level (similar to an MMO), but level scaling features to a point. For instance, if a player starts at a level 2 zone, then returns after having reached level 20, the enemies there will be scaled up to be 2-3 below the player's character.\n\nThe Sparta-Athens divide is represented in-game with a red or blue border along each region to indicate which of the city-states has control. 28 city-states feature in the game, each of which is allied with either Sparta or Athens. Each city-state has a \"national power\" level. If one city-state leader is weakened (e.g. by assassinating their leader), other faction leaders will invade their state. If the invading army is defeated, the nation's power is reset. The army will invade regardless of the player's actions, but they can involve themselves in the battle."

        "description": "Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has been the most difficult game to review in a long time. The reason is that I am absolutely in love with the character, and taking off the rose-tinted goggles to critique this game in an unbiased manner will be hard. I think I have, to an extent, achieved this. Please remember that it is okay if you disagree, and I'm eager to chat about the game with you all. However, we do not have to insult one another to prove a point. \n\nThat Boy Aqua Live: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEowSauQP2j_1fYR7BHeFMA\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBoyAqua\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thatboyaqua\n\nChannel Memberships: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwKY6YKl0-amtFsfYEDpMkA/join\n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/VBJwTUa\n\nAll music created exclusively by 444aidan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnsQizvIUJs9bAdEFd2iLew\n\nNam's Compendium: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCynMazSgjLBoA0qO3WcbdLg\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man Remastered | The Foundation for Something Greater\n\n - Chapters - \nIntroduction: 0:00\nA New Peter Parker: 3:02\nGraphics, Animations, & New York City: 5:32\nTraversal: 12:14\nCombat: 17:42\nStealth: 22:07\nGadgets: 24:25\nSuits & Suit Mods: 26:29\nJust an Arkham Clone: 28:05\nGameplay Loop & Mission Design: 31:28\nBoss Fights: 37:14\nSide Quests: 41:29\nStory & Character Analysis: 51:43\nClosing Thoughts: 1:07:16\nPost Script: 1:08:24\n\nThis video was initially going to be called Marvel Spider-man critique or Marvel's Spider-Man Analysis. But as I was writing this Marvels spiderman review I realized that it was more of a discussion piece than anything. The original release of Marvel's Spider-Man, also known as Spider-Man PS4  was met with great reviews essentially across the board and Insomniac had to deal with a few controversies surrounding the quality of the puddles? Man, the internet will get mad about literally anything they can and I think it speaks to the quality of Marvels spiderman and spiderman ps4 that the amount of puddles INSIDE a building was the centre of controversy. I could go more in depth into this “graphics downgrade” but so many others have done it better than I ever could. The game also left some questioned unanswered, such as are they saving the amazing spiderman suits for next game!? Regardless myself and a few others were quite pleased to hear that the game was being remastered for the Playstation 5 and when that was released there was a paralleling criticism relating to downgrades but this time it had to do with Peter's face. \n\n I need to bring this up now because it's easily the most prominent change in this remaster and it is still pretty controversial so here's my take on the new Peter parker face, and from this point forward, I’ll be spoiling literally everything, so consider this your one and only spoiler warning. The original Peter's face was really good. It didn’t fall into the uncanny valley and it honestly looked Iconic. The hair, the eyes, everything just screamed “chad” and he looked like Spider-Man. What I mean by that is not that he explicitly looked like another portrayal of Spider-Man but that he looked exhausted. He always looked like he barely got any sleep and was always stressed about something else. He really looked like he wasn’t always there mentally. The heavy wrinkles and bags under his eyes made him always look so burnt out and that, to me, is an accurate look for someone who spends the night taking down superhuman rhinos and old men in bird suits.\n\n New Peter looks different in spider-man remastered. He looks much younger and looks like Tom Holland's stunt double. This isn’t a bad thing necessarily but it immediately gave me a flashback to the Avengers game which had these characters that looked like it was trying too hard to give you those iconic depictions of the Avengers seen in the MCU. I have theorized that this change was made not only to fit the voice actors face which Insomniac clarified but I also think it was done to make Spider-Man fit in with a potential Marvel Video Game Universe. I imagine that Spider-Man would look out of place if he was placed with these avengers look-alikes. Now of course they could just give each Avenger their own unique design but that’s my own personal theory as to why the face was changed and I’m going to stop myself from going any further because we're missing the point.\n\nI appreciated that some suits were saved for DLC, free ones at that, such as the future foundation suit. All of the marvels spiderman DLC suits are present in this game for free. all spiderman ps4 dlc is included too which are where the spiderman ps4 dlc suits come from. One of the suits added for marvel's spiderman on the ps5 is the amazing spiderman suit. \n\nWith the release of spiderman miles morales it's clear that we are all hungry for some new spider-man game news and a full spider-man ps4 sequel. I can't wait for Marvel's spider man 2."

        "description": "#MortalShellCritique #MortalShellReview #MortalShell\n\nAn analysis of Mortal Shell - did it live up to my hype? Short answer - yes.\nPraise the parry, the unchained can't fly, and please god, help Redgrave.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA: www.twitter.com/MontyZander\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/montyzander\n\nIt’s appropriate that Mortal Shell’s trailer tells us we “seem different,” because when I began to hear about its mechanics, I thought the same thing about you Mortal Shell! I love Dark Souls & Bloodborne. Love them. The lore, the visceral combat, the atmosphere, it’s enough to make a grown man cry when you find a game series like this that seizes you by the throat and tells you you're going to like this or die trying.\n\nAnd I always like it. Maybe it’s the masochist in me – who knows.\n\nSouls-likes however often miss the mark for me. I’ve tried a lot of them, too. Lords of The Fallen? The combat’s so sluggish I was ready to feed my console some lettuce. Nioh? I despised the world and the level design. It felt like a discount FromSoftware game. The Surge I wanted so desperately to love but again – the world just didn’t engage me. I felt like I was fighting through factory after factory for the first 10 hours I tried the game and ultimately never finished it.\n\nMortal Shell is the exception. So here's my critique and review of the game. \n\n\nSocial Media\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/montyzander\nTwitch: www.twitch.tv/montyzander\n\nReferences & Clips Used\n1) Game Makers Toolkit – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx7BWayWu08\n2) The Gamer - https://www.thegamer.com/the-souls-like-genre-is-bad-game-design/\n3) How To Drink - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeM0XYpz36o\n4) Boomstick Gaming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONLBOQJZ-9s\n5) IGN Dev Interview\n6) EasyAllies - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PswZw4CleCs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Bloodborne Critique\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee3Ctns-oig"

Witness how a game can break a man as I rant and examine the story, the bugs, the glitches, the combat, the gear & loot system, the characterisation, the fact it's broken, if you can name it I guarantee I cover it here. \n\nMarvel's Avengers is an insulting mess. It's my biggest, most bitter disappointment of this generation. This cynical, insidious, at-best-misguided, made-by-committee garbage-fire hasn’t just let me down, it’s actively enraged me. \nI didn’t want to make a video like this. My intention prior to playing the beta was to ultimately make a standard critique exploring where the game’s comic-book influences came from and honestly just use it as an opportunity to gush about my favourite comics, characters, and how Crystal Dynamics have interpreted the Avengers source material. \nThen I played the beta, and my stomach turned to stone but I braved it, it was still going to be a Day 1 buy for me. Maybe I was missing something. Then I played the finished product, and my skin turned green.\n\n#content #liveservice #justice4thor #hulkneedsanewspine #theresachestwithgearcloseby #l00t\n\nDisclaimer: I made some mistakes in this video plot-wise. For example Kamala doesn't see Flynn in the \"smash\" scene and the more I think about it the more I think Kamala lifting Thor's hammer is a theme park ride. \n\nDoesn't change the fact Marvel's Avenger's sucks though.\n\nTimestamps\nIntro: 0:00\nPart 1: What Is A Live Service? - 1:51\nPart 2: It's Only A Beta - 9:42\nPart 3: A-Day, Avengers Disassembled - 15:01\nPart 4: Revenge of the Tutorial - 28:30\nPart 5: Hulk Smash (the bit where I talk about combat) - 43:19\nPart 6: The Chimera & Finding Fury - 01:04:20\nPart 7: I Am Iron Man(?) - 01:11:40\nIntermission: Avengers As A Live Service - 01:28:32  \nPart 8: Ant Hill, Born To Grind - 01:34:09\nPart 9: Getting The Band Back Together - 01:46:42 \nPart 10: Avengers in Spaaaaaace - 02:03:10\nPart 11: A Narrative-Focussed Multiplayer - 02:18:36\nPart 12: Endgame (Or When Monty Loses His Mind) - 02:26:15\nPart 13: Just Be Cool, Kid AKA I'm So Tired - 02:43:30\nPart 14: Thanks For Watching & A Wee Request - 2:46:50\n\nRewriting the Marvel Avenger's Video Game (Part1) Is out now!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOsaHMBzzEc\n\n\nSocial Media\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/MontyZander\nTwitch - https://www.twitch.tv/montyzander\n\nFootage Reference List\n1) Gamedaddy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBVGqLj6ScQ\n2) Coldside - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9JbXe8ubRc\n3) Game Informer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyVU_rgExys\n4) Shirrako - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsNIcr5OHbE\n5) Dark Lord - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbhJ5yG7Qjc\n6) IGN - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsufFcr2bpc\n7) Gamespot - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twvrwcijkd4\n8) Random Encounters - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdKZrRomPg4\n9) Bud to Boss - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkh_fyozcbk\n10) Andrew Louis - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcXfxOtCm34\n11) https://www.tweaktown.com/news/59228/square-enix-commits-games-service-business-model/index.html\n12) https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964\n13) Jim Sterling - https://youtu.be/J9ttPf8ExwQ"

I haven’t taken the time, yet, to assess what my games of this generation are, but Hellblade is right up there in the list. Whenever I’m thinking about games that I love or would recommend to friends, I always come back to it. Maybe it’s because the game’s just that good, or maybe it’s because I’m Scottish so love to see me some representation in games. Not only did Ninja Theory craft an absorbing story here, but they also ventured beyond the scope of what we would commonly understand as an “indie” game. \n\nInstead, here we’re going to take a slightly different approach. Not only will I examine Hellblade as a game in its own right, but also with the backdrop of norse mythology. I’ll be sprinkling in some of my favourite myths and tales in relation to Senua’s story, as well as exploring the narrative design and game mechanics that carry us through this 10 hour experience, and making the case for Hellblade to be one of the most important games of this generation.\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:02:48 - Part One - Who is Senua?\n00:09:43 - Part Two - Something More Tangible\n00:21:43 - Part Three - The God of Fire (Combat Analysis)\n00:38:12 - Part Four - The God of Illusion (Valravn)\n00:41:42 - IF YOU WANT TO SKIP STORYTIME WITH MONTY\n00:47:38 - Part Five - The Broken Sword\n00:58:49 - Part Six - Senua: Warrior Princess\n01:07:40 - Part Seven - The Horror of Hell\n01:17:16 - Part Eight - Fear Unmasked\n01:30:14 - Part Nine - The Gods Betray Us\n01:40:28 - Thanks For Watching\n\nMUSIC USED\nVNV Nation - Illusion\n___________________\nREFERENCES / FOOTAGE USED\n1) Leonardo Da Sidci - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52flQkqj5gs\n2) Siehste - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_BQIpkBF5o&feature=emb_title\n3) 7th Level - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTJ8AtSV0cU\n4) The Oliffen – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAqeCBNj6ZM\n5) Luke Stephens - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AR9Pj-79tk&t=300s"

But that game wasn’t without its own flaws. The combat left some room for improvement. The traversal system deserved some further complexity. The active crimes were uninspired, and most of all… the stealth system needed to be completely reconfigured for future titles. \n\nSo it’s inevitable that people like me, who think about this rendition of Spidey far too often, will have… great expectations for Spider-Man: Miles Morales. This is pretty apt seeing as this idea of “Great Expectations,” is at the core of Miles as a character, be it in the comics, his own movie, or… yes… this game.  \n\nFirst a quick disclaimer:\nWhilst I will be assessing S-triple-M on its own merits, this game is a continuation of the gameplay and story Insomniac crafted in Spider-Man PS4. Systems and mechanics are… kindof… built from and developed on so I’m also treating this critique as a… Part 2 to my analysis of the original game, so if you haven’t watched it – link’s on screen below, and while you’re foolishly clicking around, why not subscribe?

Spider-Man is spectacular, Hellblade is finely crafted, but there’s something so… fascinating about Hollow Knight. This is the toughest critique I’ve done yet, because this game has no flaws aside from nit-picks. It’s a perfect game in its own right – never-mind the astonishing value for money it possesses, and to top it all off, it has the best core fanbase of any game I’ve played. I haven’t seen any toxicity, any “git guds,” just some incredible fan-art and warm, welcoming arms wrapped around new players.\nHollow Knight is a miracle of a video game – and if you’ve played it… you know exactly why.

Spyro was my first ever mascot platformer. And still – I would argue – it’s the best of that era, because it took everything that worked in those past games, tightened up the screws, and blew some fairy-dust over the package to make it feel such a full and invigorating experience to play. \nWe’ll be walking through each game in the trilogy, but the core focus is to rate each game on its own right, whilst examining each of the components which make an effective mascot platformer. If you want my overall opinion it’s very simple, I am a Reignited Trilogy fan. Whilst it’s not perfect, I do think it’s superior to the original games as a package, so therefore I believe it’s a suitable scope to examine the Spyro games through.

        "description": "Lifeless, lazy, greedy, uncaring- If you have noticed a drop in quality over the last few years in Pokemon games, you're not alone. Doing a little research makes it easy to see why that is; rushed games, lazy executives, merchandise timing requirements- Sure, you can rush out a handheld game and maybe people won't notice as much. But a console game? That's much harder to do. In this video we go over almost every aspect of Sword and Shield, from the very start, to the \"postgame\" and I'll show you just how much they try to get away with. Dexit was only the beginning.\n\nThis is a compilation of the seperate parts of the review, the way it was intended to be published.\n\nPatreon: https://goo.gl/HZSDlN\nRadicalSoda Streams: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5eLxFr3vwk6CTHWVE5jNUw\nRadicalSoda Shop: https://crowdmade.com/collections/radicalsoda\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/RealRadicalSoda\n\nThanks for watching!"

But also cover the strange Arcade ports such as Haunted Castle and the Playchoice 10 cabinet too.\nWe will cover its obscure releases on the original Game Boy such as The Adventure (plus it's Wii remake) & Belmont's Revenge, the even more bizarre Vampire Killer, and Akumajō Dracula on the sharp x68000\nAnd of course, we will be giving special attention to the Mega Drive / Genesis release of Castlevania Bloodlines AKA the New generation before digging deep with the super Nintendo classic Super Castlevania IV before ending on probably the greatest Castlevania ever for the PC Engine AKA the Turbo Grfx16 game Rondo of Blood!\nThe less said about Castlevania Dracula X AKA Vampire Kiss...

That much is clear.

In this episode we look at all of Chapter Two: Race; as well as reconstruct a timeline for MGSV, and sketch out how it (may) connect back to the other games.\n\n\n0:00 - Introduction\n0:23 - Overview, from 'Revenge' to 'Race'\n1:51 - Overview, Episodes 28 - 31\n15:40 - Chapter Two, 'Race'\n28:47 - Analysis, 'Shining Lights, Even in Death'\n35:45 - The Trial\n51:42 - 'Peace' & Quiet\n56:11 - Overview, 'Truth: The Man Who Sold the World'\n01:01:27 - Cipher's Civil War [Timeline]\n01:17:37 - Some Baseless Rumors & Accusations\n01:25:15 - Conclusion & Finale\n01:26:58 - Credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************************************\n\n\n\"Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a third-person action-adventure game developed by Kojima Productions and published by Konami for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC on September 1, 2015.\n\nThe tenth and final main installment of the Metal Gear series, Phantom Pain follows legendary mercenary Big Boss (now known by his codename \"Venom Snake\") as he awakens in 1984 from a nine-year coma following the destruction of his private military company \"Militaires Sans Frontières\". With help from his old business partner Kazuhira Miller and rival-turned-ally Revolver Ocelot, Snake must rebuild his mercenary army (now called \"Diamond Dogs\") while plotting revenge against the shadowy organization \"Cipher,\" as well as its XOF paramilitary unit led by the enigmatic Skull Face.\n\nSimilar to its standalone prologue Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, Phantom Pain focuses on executing mission objectives in open world environments set in both Soviet-occupied Afghanistan and the Angola-Zaire border region of central Africa, complete with dynamic weather and day-night systems. Stealth is a major component of gameplay, but often optional thanks to Snake's arsenal of combat gear. Players can also upgrade Diamond Dogs' new \"Mother Base\" in a fashion similar to Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, allowing them to develop new weapons and items. In addition to its single-player campaign, the game includes two player-vs-player multiplayer modes, as well as optional microtransactions and other paid downloadable content.\n\nThe Phantom Pain is notable as the final game in the series with involvement from series creator Hideo Kojima and his Kojima Productions team. Several months before the game's release, Konami began a major restructuring of its games division, ultimately leading to Kojima Productions being treated more as a contractor rather than an internal studio. Unlike prior Metal Gear titles from the same team, Kojima Productions' logo and branding is absent from promotional materials and packaging for the final game. After leaving Konami, Kojima would go on to establish a new independent studio with the same name in 2015.\n\nThe Phantom Pain was bundled together with Ground Zeroes and all DLC as Metal Gear Solid V: The Definitive Experience in late 2016 for Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Phantom Pain's gameplay and graphics engine were later reused for the 2018 survival-focused spin-off title Metal Gear Survive.\""

Hideo Kojima said he chose to focus his attention on Peace Walker rather than its console-bound brother, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, which was simultaneously in development.\n\nKojima has reiterated several times that Peace Walker is, from his perspective, \"Metal Gear Solid 5\", and, were it on the home consoles, it would have been given a numbered title. \"Since it is on PSP,\" Kojima said in an interview with Official PlayStation Magazine, \"I did not officially number it. But the game design, story, number of staff and budget-you can say that this is a big project. It would've been number 5. It’s not a side story or a spin-off. It’s not like Portable Ops or Acid.

With 85 hours playtime in, all side missions done, 4/5 endings experienced, and 85% of the achievements I feel compelled to weigh in here. Whether its cyber-augmentations whose effects go largely un-noticed after installed (either due to bugs or bad design); its dizzying large and detailed city scape where every....last....damn....building cannot be entered, let alone explored. A hyper linear story where you are forced to watch pseudo-cutscenes of beautifully rendered characters talk at you while you wait for the gameplay to start, or a lack of anything at all to do in the world outside of side missions; this game was beyond disappointing. While not a bad game overall, it merely acts as an interesting distraction and is just another Ubisoft open world meets GTA when it could've been one of the most compelling games of all time. CD Projekt, next time cut the acting budget by 90% and focus on making an actual game world. \n\n\nSupport the vids here:  https://www.patreon.com/lookingglassed"

Such factors may lie dormant within us all - a choice waiting to be made. For every being since the advent of life itself.\"\n- Evo-Devo Biologist\n\n\nWhile divisive upon release, 2019's Death Stranding has grown somewhat in public esteem since the calamitous events of 2020. After a year in the wild, what can be said about Hideo Kojima's first post-METAL GEAR SOLID game that hasn't been said before?\n\nWell it turns out, plenty. \n\nIn this, a Futurasound Productions Holiday Special, join me as I dive into the game with a year's worth of hindsight, covering not only Death Stranding itself, but my own previous videos on the subject, to see how timefall has treated them all since release.\n\nAlong the way, we'll cover why DS isn't a walking simulator, what makes it revolutionary for the open world sandbox genre, and why it's underrated not only purely as a new kind of video game, but also as a 'bridge' between game design and an ethic of altruism. \n\n\nApologies to newest credited backers Among Blain and Ryan Barbadillo, I finished this video a little while ago.

The game's main plot revolves around creating connections, or \"strands,\" linking isolated survivors and cities to each other in an effort to rebuild society.\n\nThe game features the performances (including voice acting, likenesses, and dialogue motion capture) of numerous veteran actors for its central characters, most notably Norman Reedus as the playable protagonist and Mads Mikkelsen as the central antagonist. Other notable actors include Léa Seydoux, Lindsay Wagner, Margaret Qualley, Tommie Earl Jenkins, and Troy Baker. Film directors Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn are also featured, though in likeness only."

Arkane Studios was the studio behind Arx Fatalis and Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, and would have had a couple other titles had they been more savvy with their contracts.  Dishonored's credits include names like Raphael Colantonio, Harvey Smith, and Bethesda Game Softworks (of course Bethesda is here).  These guys worked on games like System Shock, Thief, and Deus Ex, which of course inspires a long conversation about Immersive Sims.   \n\nSOURCES - \nBethesda's shady business isn't unusual - https://www.archive.is/vsmve\nInfinite Bodies Tweak - https://archive.is/Z7hL1\nDark Messiah of Might and Magic Trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXzBwMW5pzw&t=13s\nArx Fatalis Trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMm22gl2dJo\nHunt Down the Freeman Trailer - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4oSJiR1lM\nHalf Life Alyx Meeting the Vortigaunt - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiKw_NJiXAI\n\n#Patrician"

It was also a 1991 release for the Game Boy, every ambition it had tarnished by time. More than any other game in the series, Metroid II needed a remake. And when it finally happened, it would be Metroid's return to prominence after seven long years.\n\nI can't overstate how critical my Patreon backers are.

        "description": "Review copy provided by Ubisoft. This does not influence my opinion of the game.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Valhalla is arguably the biggest Assassin’s Creed game ever, with multiple maps exponentially larger than that of previous installments, enough side content to fill a game on its own, and an overarching plot that spans well over the 50-hour mark. This game has so much content in it that I found myself pondering, How much Assassin’s Creed is too much Assassin’s Creed? Is Assassins Creed Valhalla Waste of Time? This is the 7th video in my Assassins Creed Retrospective.\n\nWhitelight: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVWhVAZwCdQsPZL-mDLcxPQ\n\nNam's Compendium: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCynMazSgjLBoA0qO3WcbdLg\n\nMore Assassin's Creed Critiques: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0F9j7JFoiE&list=PL0hudNq_z8tAGlGjO5ehnoxvuPJqiWApx&ab_channel=ThatBoyAqua\n\nThat Boy Aqua Live: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEowSauQP2j_1fYR7BHeFMA\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBoyAqua\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/thatboyaqua\n\nChannel Memberships: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwKY6YKl0-amtFsfYEDpMkA/join\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/VBJwTUa\n\nAll music created exclusively by 444aidan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnsQizvIUJs9bAdEFd2iLew\nChapters of A Critique of Assassin's Creed Valhalla | Too Much Assassin's Creed: \nIntroduction: 0:00\nPresentation: 2:55\nCombat: 6:27\nStealth: 15:58\nTraversal: 17:47\n(Spoilers) The Order of The Ancients: 20:11\n(Spoilers) Minigames & Viking Hyjinks: 25:03\n(Spoilers) Side Quests: 27:29\n(Spoilers) Boss Fights: 28:49\n(Spoilers) Raiding and Upgrading: 29:58\n(Spoilers) The Arcs of England: 32:07\n(Spoilers) Story Summary: 40:13\n(Spoilers) The Story, The Lore, & The Pacing: 45:11\n(Spoilers) Concluding Thoughts: 57:03\nPost Script: 1:04:20\n\n\nA Critique of Assassin's Creed Valhalla | Too Much Assassin's Creed\n\nI plan to answer this question throughout a critique of Assassin's Creed Valhalla. I plan to discuss all of my praises and criticisms across this video, and I hope to present to you the story explained, the lore explained, the ending explained, and my praises of the gameplay, my critiques of the Assassins Creed Valhalla Combat, and, of course, the things I don't like as much. I will show the gameplay of Assassin's Creed Valhalla and I will show endgame footage and the many endings of the game. In this Analysis of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, I will be comparing the game to its predecessor in an Assassins Creed Valhalla VS Odyssey battle. I have tried to cover all the arcs but there were some I skipped over. These are my Assassins Creed Valhalla First Impressions and I really like this take on Assassins Creed Vikings. In Assassins Creed Valhalla all arcs must be completed to complete the main story.\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is an action role-playing video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the twelfth major installment and the twenty-second release in the Assassin's Creed series, and a successor to the 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Set in 873 AD, the game recounts a fictional story during the Viking invasion of Britain. The player controls Eivor, a Viking raider who becomes embroiled in the conflict between the Brotherhood of Assassins and the Templar Order.\n\n\nMy time with Assassin’s Creed Valhalla was really really fun, I mean don’t get me wrong there were a few bumps in the road but overall I think this is an Assassin’s Creed game that will please all the different Assassin’s Creed fans weather you are an OG who’s been here since the beginning, or a fresh recruit who has only known the series in it’s RPG form. I wrote that statement, 15 hours into the game, Now that I am on the cusp of 90 hours I can confidently say, I feel a little differently now.  Now since this game is relatively new I will be structuring this video differently in order to avoid spoilers. If you scroll across that little red bar at the bottom of this video, you will see that this video is split into chapters. Anything that spoils the game after the first 4 ish hours will be marked with SPOILERS in all caps and it will pertain to either gameplay or story. Of course story spoilers will include spoilers for character arcs, plot twists, and everything else and gameplay spoilers will include abilities, cosmetics, weapons, and side quests. I’d like to say off the bat that if you have been on the fence and you want to go in as blind as possible but you're just not sure about it, get this game, it answers a lot of concerns surrounding Odyssey and it’s also a ton of fun in general. If you are willing to have a few minor things spoiled in order to help you decide then proceed with caution."

While there are aspects of the game I adore, a large majority of the game is flawed in a way I couldn't ignore. Today's video essay finally dives into my feelings on the matter. It's a big one, so I hope you enjoy the longer format. I actually edited this script down dozens of times from originally a near hour-long version, so it should at least be more streamlined.

This is a video essay on SOMA, and while I don't recount every story event and decision in the game, it is necessary for me to spoil the story.\n\nSOMA is a video game developed by Frictional Games released way back in the distant past of 2015.\n\nSimon Jarrett awakens from one nightmare only to plunge headfirst into another.\nThis game pushed me through such an emotional roller-coaster of euphoric highs and crushingly isolating lows, that when I walked my girl through the story, I was an emotional wreck. A game I had beaten days ago, upon recounting the journey was still affecting me to the point that I was breaking down in tears again.\nSOMA was one of the most powerful video games I have ever played, and I knew I had to make a video essay on it explain why, and hopefully, to excite someone else to follow in my footsteps.\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/yDdAWuw\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zygart3\n\nPurchase here: https://somagame.com/"

        "description": "Sorry if I sound tired during the first part of the video, Uni has really been kicking my ass!\n\nSo far everything I have seen and experienced has been truly phenomenal when it comes to the design of a Monster Hunter entry and the sheer amount of content offered even by this point in the series is pretty nuts. I honestly can’t believe we have never gotten to experience some of this content within mainline releases and here’s hoping to the future with the announcement of Monster Hunter Rise, that we’ll see Capcom a little more receptive to the idea of bringing over some frontier monsters. \n\nTwitter ► https://twitter.com/SuperRADLemon\nDiscord ► https://discord.gg/zfTtFH9\n\nCera Twitch ► https://www.twitch.tv/cera_cymmetry\nCera YT ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBmYOa2wr4-xlcX_ZaO67RA\nCera Twitter ► https://twitter.com/ceracymmetry\n\nFist.Moe ► https://fist.moe/\nAscalon YT ► https://www.youtube.com/c/AscalonFI77\nKinoKreations (Cera's Profile Picture) ► https://twitter.com/KinoKreations\n\nSources:\n\nMHF JPN WIKI ► https://w.atwiki.jp/giurasu/pages/427.html\nMH Fandom WIKI ► https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Wiki\n\nTimeStamps:\n\nIntro - 0:00\nForward 1 - 2:16\nForward 2 - 8:00\nForward 3 - 12:00\nForward 4 - 13:51\nForward 5 - 16:47\nOutro - 21:27\n\nMusic:\n\nMusic Credit: LAKEY INSPIRED\nTrack Name: \"Falling\", \"Chill Day\", \"Beach Dayz\", \"Electric\", \"Watching the Clouds\", \"Fast Lane\"\nMusic By: LAKEY INSPIRED\nOfficial SoundCloud  https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\nOfficial YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmy8wuTpC95lefU5d1dt2Q\nLicense for commercial use: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported \"Share Alike\" (CC BY-SA 3.0) \nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode\nMusic promoted by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ\nwww.ChillOutMedia.com / www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\n#MonsterHunter #MHF  #Frontier #SuperRad #SuperRadical #SuperRadikahl"

        "description": "In the previous video, I mentioned that frontier is much closer to your traditional monster hunter experience than you may think, with the main differences being the extended grind factor due to being an MMO, as well as how ludicrously powerful both monsters and hunters can become through updates and progression. I think within season 1 to 5, the only really excessive design choices we’ve seen so far were the evolution of Espinas’ moveset and abilities, but excessive isn’t a negative connotation in this sense. Rather excessive is the name of the game. A deliberate design choice to push traditional monster hunters to its limits within a non-mainline entry within the series. \n\nTwitter ► https://twitter.com/SuperRADLemon\nDiscord ► https://discord.gg/zfTtFH9\n\nFist.Moe ► https://fist.moe/\nCera Twitch ► https://www.twitch.tv/cera_cymmetry\nCera YT ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBmYOa2wr4-xlcX_ZaO67RA\nAscalon YT ► https://www.youtube.com/c/AscalonFI77\n\nSources:\n\nMHF JPN WIKI ►https://w.atwiki.jp/giurasu/pages/427.html\nMH Fandom WIKI ►https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Wiki\n\nTimeStamps:\n\nIntro - 0:00\nSeason 6  - 2:07\nSeason 7 - 4:44\nSeason 8 - 8:03\nSeason 9 - 12:39\nSeason 10 - 16:20\nOutro - 19:36\n\nMusic:\n\nMusic:\n\nMusic Credit: LAKEY INSPIRED\nTrack Name: \"Falling\", \"Chill Day\", \"Beach Dayz\", \"Electric\", \"Watching the Clouds\", \"Fast Lane\"\nMusic By: LAKEY INSPIRED\nOfficial SoundCloud  https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\nOfficial YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmy8wuTpC95lefU5d1dt2Q\nLicense for commercial use: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported \"Share Alike\" (CC BY-SA 3.0) \nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode\nMusic promoted by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ\nwww.ChillOutMedia.com / www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\n#MonsterHunter #MHF  #Frontier #SuperRad #SuperRadical #SuperRadikahl"

        "description": "Monster Hunter Frontier is notorious within the Monster Hunter community due to a lot of players that have not gotten to experience it calling it “not a real Monster Hunter game”, which makes sense as it’s a spinoff MMORPG designed for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft windows service, two consoles that never saw releases for the series by this point in time. I can think back to discussions on the game with other Monster Hunter fanatics and a lot of disdain surrounding some of the mechanics, but mostly the monster hunter designs, as they get progressively more flamboyant and intricate in comparison to the grounded designs found within the mainline series. \n\nBut maybe Frontier wasn’t that bad. In fact, maybe through its development and updates and releases, it’s actually an incredibly good, albeit difficult Monster Hunter experience. Maybe some of these monster designs and mechanics are incredibly unique. Maybe some of these monsters would even make it over to the mainline series.\n\nTwitter ► https://twitter.com/SuperRADLemon\nDiscord ► https://discord.gg/zfTtFH9\n\nFist.Moe ► https://fist.moe/\nCera Twitch ► https://www.twitch.tv/cera_cymmetry\nCera YT ► https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBmYOa2wr4-xlcX_ZaO67RA\nAscalon YT ► https://www.youtube.com/c/AscalonFI77\n\nSources:\n\nMHF JPN WIKI ►https://w.atwiki.jp/giurasu/pages/427.html\nMH Fandom WIKI ►https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Wiki\n\nTimeStamps:\n\nIntro - 0:00\nHistory - 3:10\nSeason 1 - 6:16\nSeason 2 - 10:00\nSeason 3 - 13:16\nSeason 4 - 15:46\nSeason 5 - 18:56\nOutro - 21:48\n\nMusic:\n\nMusic Credit: LAKEY INSPIRED\nTrack Name: \"Falling\", \"Chill Day\", \"Beach Dayz\", \"Electric\", \"Watching the Clouds\", \"Fast Lane\", \"Sweet Dreams\"\nMusic By: LAKEY INSPIRED\nOfficial SoundCloud  https://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired\nOfficial YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOmy8wuTpC95lefU5d1dt2Q\nLicense for commercial use: Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported \"Share Alike\" (CC BY-SA 3.0) \nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode\nMusic promoted by: Chill Out Records @ https://goo.gl/fh3rEJ\nwww.ChillOutMedia.com / www.LoFi-HipHop.com\n\n#MonsterHunter #MHF  #Frontier #SuperRad #SuperRadical #SuperRadikahl"

Today we’ll be focusing on Monster Hunter World's expansion, Iceborne, part of the most successful game to be released in the series as well as Capcom's best selling game of all time.\n\nCovering all of these generations leading up to World and Iceborne has been a treat to say the least. It’s amazing to see the changes that the series has made from generation one to five. Where we are now is so drastically different from where we started and I can tell you that going through and playing each game in the series for these videos has been a nostalgia fueled marathon that I’m incredibly happy I had the opportunity to experience.\n\nHistory Playlist ► https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhW2dgyg2f5-JsnuXlEXVwHHqrmBucatG\nMHW Opinion Piece ► https://youtu.be/LKSw3JZr_pM\nTwitter ► https://twitter.com/SuperRADLemon\nDiscord ► https://discord.gg/zfTtFH9\n\nMods:\n\nHD Remastered Mizutsune Longsword Tamonowo ►https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/3289\nDark Ninja ► https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/3153/\n\nHello everyone and welcome back to another lesson on the history of the Monster Hunter series.

So Heroes is most certainly NOT a bad game, nor the start of the Dark Age, it instead the next epic Sonic game to receive the in depth analysis treatment!"

Maybe especially the weirdest things.

I haven't seen any Persona 3 Fes Analysis videos that go into as much detail as I have in this one. This is my longest video yet, and I hope I did the game justice. \n\n\n\nThis video wouldn't have been possible without the help from Aqua.

Since then, the main protagonist of Persona 5 made it into smash brothers ultimate as a guest fighter, and a slue of spinoffs and rereleases have been populating the franchise ever since."

Persona 4 is a very special game for me and in this Analysis, I'll be going over the good and the bad. As well as explaining how Persona 4 changed my life. Persona 4 is the game that changed my life forever after I played it. This Persona 4 review will contain spoilers as it's an in-depth analysis. \n\nThis is a follow up to my Persona 3 Analysis so there will be light Persona 3 spoilers. \n\n0:00 Opening\n3:30 Persona 4's introduction\n13:52 Combat \n20:37 Fusion & Dungeon Design\n24:01 Social Link Go!\n1:09:21 Party Member Discussion & Analysis\n1:37:10 Story Analysis & Conclusion\n2:16:49 Patreon Credits & Outro\n\n\n\nSo the last time we were here, I took a deep look at Persona 3 FES for the PS2. And while I think the game was pretty good, it was just shy from true greatness. I had my issues, some small, others not so small. But at the end of that video, I still recommended the game while also mentioning that I actually preferred Persona 4 over that game. So allow me to take some time out of your day to explain why. \n\nPersona 4 is a game that needs next to no introduction. For the longest time, Persona 4 was the main moneymaker for the company Atlus. While I attribute a lot of Persona’s mainstream success to Persona 5, Persona 4 wasn’t exactly an unknown game. If you were a fan of JRPG’s at the time, you most likely heard of Persona 4, even if it was in passing. It also helps that Persona 4’s legacy didn’t just end after one game."

In this critique, we're going to find out why. \n\nEditor And Thumbnail Artist: David Blom\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/leavedavidalone\n\nSource for one of the time travel points: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlp8Xi1Nolg\n\nSPECULATION ON MAX'S POWERS: \n\nIf everything else rewinds while Max stays put, that should apply to air. There are two possibilities. Either the air phases into Max, which would kill her by saturating her blood with air, or Max instantly displaces the air that she teleports into, which could have a number of catastrophic effects depending on whether or not the air is moved out of the way, or teleported out of the way. Moved would have to happen infinitely faster than the speed of light, who knows what would happen then. I remember hearing that going faster than light sends you backwards in time, so infinite speed would send you back to when time began. The big bang, in other words. The air you displaced would thusly become the first atoms in the history of the universe, the butterfly effect of which would change every minute detail of the universe as we know it, deleting Max, Earth, everything and causing a grandfather paradox. I smell a fanfiction!!!\n\nIf scientists are wrong about faster than light travel sending you back in time (or I'm dumb, which is vastly more likely), then infinite speed equals infinite energy which could potentially destroy the entire universe in a blaze of not-glory. I don’t know if particles would default down back to light speed, or if they’d all become kugelblitz blackholes creating a 100% efficient mass to energy conversion, but any way you have it, Max dies. If air is teleported rather than moved, particles might not have gained kinetic energy, but if two phase into each other, that’s not something observed anywhere else in nature. The effects are incalculable, you could create a vaccum decay that would destroy the observable universe, or a strangelet that would convert earth into to a new type of matter. Who knows man. I wish I did because overthinking this is really fun.\n\nIt’s also completely possible that Max could phase into someone else, instantly killing both of them if she was lucky, or she could phase two objects together just by putting her phone down, picking up a brush, then rewinding, which would have the phone warp into her hand, the hand that is currently also holding the brush. \n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/whitelightYT\nDiscord: Whitelight#4493\n\nSongs in order of appearance:\n\nHush You - Velvet Moon\n\nVargtimmen - Da Sein\n\nUnbroken - Sunfish Grove\n\nLook Where That Got You - Mattie Maguire\n\nDiaphanous Dreamcoats - Silver Maple\n\nMiss Emeli - General Vibe\n\nGood Days - Cody Francis\n\nLucky Man - Red Revision\n\nHer Own Device - Gavin Luke\n\nFire, Then Nothing - Da Sein\n\nCloser Than Two Of A Kind - Jaydan Talley\n\nSleep Movies - First Wave\n\nBlessed Original Instrumental - Wayne John Bradley https://soundcloud.com/ayneohnradley/blessed\n\nDance Dance - Psuche\n\nDark Clouds Warm Day - At The End of Ties, Nothing \n\nDance Dance (Instrumental Version) - Psuche\n\nDivine - Amaranth Cove\n\nAs always, thanks to ChimerainaSuit for over half of the thumbnails on the channel.\n\nRecommended Channels:\n\nRennsReviews: https://www.youtube.com/user/RennsReviews\n\nGingertail: https://www.youtube.com/user/Nyasu93"

I'm here to go into detail with SA2 to explain why it works, and why I, and many other people enjoy it. In this part, we'll go into every part of the general gameplay, as well as the Multiplayer and Chao World, as well as the soundtrack, art design, and character design. Part 2 will analyze the story, and go into individual levels. \n\nWatch my SA1 analysis first if you haven't already:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7AuitP5FIE\n\nTWITCH  ►: https://www.twitch.tv/ruby_of_blue\nPATREON ►: https://www.patreon.com/RubyofBlue\nDISCORD ►: https://discord.gg/NYg5cGy\nTWITTER ►: https://twitter.com/RubyofBlue\nDEVIANTART ►: http://rubyofblue.deviantart.com/\n\nRecommended Mods:\nRetranslated: https://gamebanana.com/gamefiles/7122\nBright Chao Fix: https://github.com/Exant64/BrightFix/releases\nFixed Sound Effect Volume: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzR3KID2PD0\n\nRecommended Viewing:\nhttps://dreamcastify.unreliable.network/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ii63QA_lBQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMauzPcOorQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3SKkeWc9f8&list=PLxo4wseRbUXZqiAtkblpDK55wMfZly7hu\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpFsXjZZPks\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y7ltXKg-hc&list=PLECYq24__PXv_VpV0rRfE1Jx6sL_pfEkv\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Sapphirechao\nhttps://www.polygon.com/features/2017/4/17/15099400/how-sega-moved-sonic-from-2d-to-3d\n\nResources:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_CI2QHm1nazyeE6QYbALg/about\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/TurkishBullet19/featured\nhttps://www.longplays.eu/news.php\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyTS--xfUqo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMauzPcOorQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC4zbj30dhw\nhttps://chao-island.com/\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO PATRONS:\nVinvan Artsy\nFungo\nAvoryBritish\nBrandon Lameyer\nOmni Discussions\nTalmanaze\nDoublajynxx\nLevin\nThe Phoenix Library\nXtremetuberVII\nKorban22\nGreenZangoose28\n\n#sonicadventure #gameanalysis #sonicthehedgehog"

        "description": "A common accusation levied against naughty dog is that their games are only as powerful and effective as their narratives. This makes sense on the outset considering that their games usually rely on character development, flashy graphics, and high budget action sequences that make you feel as though you're playing through an interactive summer blockbuster. However, since going back through the Uncharted games for these critiques I can't help but feel as though this estimation is limited. What I mean is that there's a lot more to naughty dog's games than just the narrative, and I think that Uncharted 2 is a perfect example. You see, Uncharted 2's story is crap. In addition, the original Uncharted story is crap. These games did not claw their way into gamers' hearts and Memories by way of magnificent storytelling.

        "description": "https://twitter.com/ludiscere\nhttps://patreon.com/ludiscere\n\n(if you're here from the FFII video, hello! the timestamps you're looking for are 4:25 for version differences, and 17:22 for combat. thanks for checking this out!)\n\nhello everyone! this is the first video in a series in which i will be going through every main series Final Fantasy game (and some others too probably) in order to give them a wee bit of in-depth analysis, and figure out what makes each individual FF game tick. i'll be focusing on various things like development history, gameplay analysis, and musical analysis, but i'll also be drawing from outside sources like linguistics and mythology to try and understand as much as possible why these games are the way they are, and why people love them so much.\n\neven though this video is nearly an hour long, there's a lot i didn't talk about, or that i'd like to clarify:\n- the original NES game came packaged with a lot of supplementary help like maps, and enemy info. although this would have played a huge role in experiencing the game back in the 80s i decided not to include it within the analysis, mostly just to see how well the game managed to stand on its own two feet. if you're interested though,you can find what it all looked like here: https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NABJE.pdf\n- i didn't discuss level grinding and the Peninsula of Power. i couldn't really fit these in and tie them to any other interesting overarching points without it feeling forced, so i made the decision to ultimately leave them out. the game is pretty grindy, though.\n- unfortunately, i didn't talk about some of the best songs in the game, like 'Castle Cornelia' and 'Matoya's Cave'. a lot of the music in this game is hard to analyse because it's quite simplistic and underdeveloped in comparison to later entries in the series, and i'm by no means an expert. this is partly due to old hardware limitations, but predominantly due to Uematsu's style shift as the music begins to match the narrative more and more as the games go on. i say it in the video, but it's FFIV where this really starts to take off. the music is still banging though.\n\nif you're interested, the songs used in this video are:\nTerra's Theme (FFVI) - 0:01\nOverworld (NES) - 1:45\nShop (NES) - 3:52\nPrelude (PSP) - 5:49\nChurch (PSP) - 7:14\nMenu (NES) - 8:06\nTown (PSP) - 9:31\nCastle Cornelia (PSP) - 11:18\nChaos Temple (PSP) - 13:12\nMain Theme (NES) - 14:43\nBattle Scene (Black Mages) - 17:23\nBattle Scene (PSP) - 21:37\nDungeon (PSP) - 24:03\nMatoya's Cave (PSP) - 25:25\nMt Gulg (PSP) - 27:35\nAirship (PSP) - 29:39\nShip (PSP) - 31:03\nMatoya's Cave (Black Mages) - 32:15\nGurgu Volcano (NES) - 36:12\nDungeon (PSP) - 37:01\nVictory Fanfare (NES) - 38:27\nSunken Shrine (PSP) - 39:40\nTown (NES) - 43:04\nFlying Fortress (PSP) - 44:34\nChaos Temple (PSP) - 46:50\nEnding Theme (PSP) - 51:25\nMain Theme (London Philharmonic Orchestra) - 52:42\nsorry about some songs being used twice! there aren't many songs in FFI, and they're all super short.\n\nas for sources for the interviews i used, you can find them here:\n- Sakaguchi on FF's name: https://www.famitsu.com/news/201505/24079276.html (this is in Japanese btw)\n- Uematsu on FF's name: https://www.wired.com/2009/07/final-fantasy/\n- Uematsu on the Prelude: https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2014/10/nobuo-uematsu-interview\n- Uematsu on the FF Main Theme: https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/19/nobuo-uematsu-remembers-20-years-of-final-fantasy-soundtracks\n- Ito on combat/sport: https://kotaku.com/wow-final-fantasys-combat-really-is-based-on-football-5954150 (the original interview link is dead, this is the best i can offer)\n\nfootage used throughout the video:\n- FFX intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0x1Rr6fxvQ\n- FFIX intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkYd7s06jU\n- FFVIII cutscenes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V04DwhMiv7A\n- FFVI opera scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe3pGU9jcag\n- FFXIII Eden infiltration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQazC8hWAZs\n- FFXV intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwc6TyCTjEM\n- FFIV 'Anxieties' scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT_kuQ4c68Y\n- Dragon Quest boss: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JuB1h55-9Y\nthe rest of the footage was captured by me. but please check out the above videos and their creators! \n\nalso, i spelled 'slightly' wrong just after 5 minutes into the video. mortifying. get someone else to proof-read your work.\n\nfinally, a huge thanks to my best pal Joe, without whom this channel would be much worse off. Joe has done all the art for my channel from its inception, from the old logo to the new black mage logo, the old intro and all the outros, and most recently the incredible art for my Patreon tiers! he is an immensely talented artist and an absolute legend so check him out:\nhttps://twitter.com/SteakJoe\nhttps://www.instagram.com/steakjoeart/\n\nthank you all so much for reading this far and i sincerely hope you enjoyed the video!\n\n- alastair x"

But Commander Shepard is different. What does it mean to have a character whose personality and identity is shared between the player and the character?\n\nSupport Game Maker's Toolkit on Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/GameMakersToolkit\n\nJoin the GMTK Game Jam\nhttps://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] This role could also be played by the character Kaidan Alenko, depending on who survived the events of Mass Effect 1. To streamline the video, I’m using Ashley whenever I need to talk about the “Virmire survivor”.\n\n[2] There are other possible choices, one of which involves using a \"Charm\" or \"Intimidate\" line to get Tali off scot-free without presenting the evidence. This is just one of many examples of the rewards for playing pure Paragon or pure Renegade being far too tempting…\n\nSources\n\nMass Effect Interview | IGN\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/19/mass-effect-interview-2\n\nJohn Ebenger | Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/EbengerJohn/status/1230205582478458880\n\nMass Effect 3 by the numbers | PC Gamer\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/uk/mass-effect-3-infographic/\n\nThe Walking Dead: Bringing the World's Smartest Zombie Series to Life | Redbull\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20150209213003/http://www.redbull.co.uk/cs/Satellite/en_UK/Article/The-Walking-Dead--Bringing-the-world-021243300828382\n\nBioWare Explains Why There's No Homosexuality in Mass Effect 2 | 1UP\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20120724180604/http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9026170\n\nAssassin’s Creed Odyssey director apologizes for forcing characters into a traditional relationship | Polygon\nhttps://www.polygon.com/2019/1/17/18186911/assassins-creed-odyssey-dlc-romance-apology\n\nThe Witcher History #2 - E3 2004 | ryslaw on YouTube\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBWlnL6Tr6k\n\nGames shown in this episode (in order of appearance)\n\nGone Home (2013)\nThe Last of Us (2013)\nMetal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (2015)\nHorizon Zero Dawn (2017)\nPillars of Eternity (2015)\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006)\nVampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines (2004)\nDeus Ex (2000)\nPlanescape: Torment (1999)\nMass Effect (2007)\nUncharted 2: Among Thieves (2009)\nMass Effect 2 (2010)\nMass Effect 3 (2012)\nHalo 3 (2007)\nUncharted: Drake's Fortune (2007)\nGears of War (2006)\nMetal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (2008)\nDragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age (2018)\nPersona 5 (2017)\nThe Outer Worlds (2019)\nFallout 4 (2015)\nFallout 3 (2008)\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (2003)\nLife Is Strange: Before the Storm (2017)\nDetroit: Become Human (2018)\nThe Wolf Among Us (2013)\nThe Walking Dead: Season One (2012)\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001)\nLife is Strange (2015)\nKingdom Hearts III (2019)\nDragon Age II (2011)\nFallout: New Vegas (2010)\nJade Empire (2005)\nDragon Age: Origins (2009)\nDishonored 2 (2016)\nAssassin's Creed II (2009)\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (2013)\nAssassin's Creed: Odyssey (2018)\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla (2020)\nMonster Hunter: World (2018)\nHeaven’s Vault (2019)\nThe Last of Us Part II (2020)\nMafia III (2016)\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (2011)\nDeus Ex: Mankind Divided (2016)\nYakuza 6: The Song of Life (2016)\nDisco Elysium (2019)\nAlpha Protocol (2010)\nMass Effect: Andromeda (2017)\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015)\nThe Witcher (2007)\nThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings (2011)\n\nMusic used in this episode\n\nMusic provided by Music Vine - https://musicvine.com/\n\nMass Effect soundtrack used with permission from Electronic Arts\n\nThe Witcher 3 soundtrack used in accordance with CD Projekt Red policy - https://cdprojektred.com/en/videopolicy\n\nVideo sections\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n03:13 - Part I (Shepard, Commander)\n05:41 - Part II (Paragon of Humanity)\n20:52 - Part III (Company Man)\n28:58 - Part IV (Shepard's Flock)\n44:12 - Part V (Create a Commander)\n49:14 - Part VI (Commanding Shepard)\n52:48 - Ending\n\nOther credits\n\n24 and Fox News © Fox Broadcasting Company\nStar Trek © ViacomCBS\n\nContribute translated subtitles - https://amara.org/v/C3BDq/"

Then a pop filter finally arrived the day after I finished editing. So did the chair I also ordered in March. That's hilarious! This darn virus broke my lungs AND (damaged) my back. Oh well!"

        "description": "https://linktr.ee/cgquarterly\n\nEpisode 50 - When the Super Nintendo launched in August of 1991, its launch lineup was solid, but small.  The legendary Super Mario World was of course the pack-in game, but the only other games on the shelf that day were Pilotwings and F-Zero.  While Sega would latch on to the fact that, having released two years prior, the Genesis had a much larger library, several games were released on the Super Nintendo in 1991 that have come to be considered absolute classics on the system.  Gradius III, one of the best shooters on the console, came out about a week after launch, and other noteworthy titles released that year include ActRaiser, Final Fantasy II, Super Ghouls'n Ghosts, and Super Castlevania IV.\n\nShow Notes:\n\n- That is veteran character actor “Mike Starr” in the SNES commercial at the beginning of the video.\n\n- This is the longest \"documentary\" style episode I've ever made, at just over 1 hour long.\n\n- The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past was originally announced as an Autumn 1991 release, but the game was delayed until early 1992.\n\n- Work began on this video in June of 2017, and the episode was finished 10 minutes before midnight on December 31st.\n\n- All gameplay footage was captured using an RGB-modded model 2 Super Nintendo upscaled through a Framemeister and recorded using an Elgato Game Capture HD.\n\nMusic courtesy of Kevin MacLeod (www.smartsound.com/royalty-free-music/i­ncompetech)\n\nClassic Gaming Quarterly\nPO Box 73126\nDavis, CA 95617\n\n#CGQuarterly #LaunchVids #SuperNintendo"

I see it as a truly special psychological horror game that does NOT glorify violence, but rather treats it as a disturbing and twisted element of horror in a dark and intense game. Despite its simple design, it manages to be a pretty scary experience.

Today, I want to challenge the widespread idea that this piece of history is a giant turd by sharing why I personally thought it was delightful, and why it gained the popularity it had. But do I only have positive things to say about it?

        "description": "Please consider supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GVMERS\r\n\nOf all the video game genres, few are as taxing – or rewarding – as stealth games. Whether they involve sneaking past security cameras in a future dystopia, or hiding from bloodthirsty guards in the ancient past, stealth games are often slow and stressful affairs, lacking the pizzazz or immediate gratification that so many other experiences offer. But when everything comes together, and one squeezes through their quiet gauntlets without leaving a trace, the sense of satisfaction that they provide is unlike anything else. \n\n For a generation of gamers, few other experiences epitomized this better than Looking Glass Studios’s Thief: The Dark Project. Where competing stealth titles like Metal Gear Solid allowed players to go full Rambo at the drop of a hat, The Dark Project forced its audience to keep to the shadows, and use every affordance its mechanics and environments provided in order to avoid being caught. It was among its genre’s most formative experiences, and it was followed shortly after its release by a sequel that all but improved its greatest qualities – establishing both as being among the greatest gaming duologies of their era.\n\n Unfortunately, no sooner had the series made itself known than Looking Glass was forced to close its doors, and its ownership was passed on to Ion Storm’s Austin branch. The latter would do its best amid trying circumstances to do Thief justice, and deliver a game that, while not perfect, would have plenty of strong points. But like a curse from on high, this third entry would neither save Ion Storm from its own subsequent demise, nor prevent the series from resting afterwards in peace.\n \nWere this all that there was to Thief’s history, one wouldn’t be remiss calling it tragic. Yet in between all of its mainline titles, the series saw no shortage of support from its fans, who did their best to keep its memory alive with pro bono projects of stunning ambition. And when these fans were also triple-A developers, the games that they produced rarely failed to do the same.\nThis is the rise and fall of Thief.\n\r\nSupport the channel by becoming a member:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/GVMERS/join\r\n\r\nSubscribe to GVMERS:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=GVMERS\r\n\nFollow GVMERS on Twitter: \nhttps://twitter.com/GVMERS_\n\r\nLike GVMERS on Facebook:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GVMERS\r\n\r\nJoin the GVMERS Discord channel:\r\nhttps://discord.gg/sZApcwx\r\n\r\nSubscribe to the GVMERS subreddit: \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GVMERS/"

I do. The UK never had access to PlayStation Underground, which was a virtual magazine series in the US that shipped a brand new PS1 demo to you every quarter of the year from a subscription - but we DID have access to the monthly Official UK PlayStation Magazine - or OPM. This series of magazines bundled in an exclusive UK PS1 demo disc every month with the latest games, trailers and exclusive behind-the-scenes video footage at a low price. You also got some brilliant examples of a ps1 demo disc menu and even the best ever ps1 demo disc music - seriously, the soundtrack for these demos was insane. So much nostalgia. I even take a brief look at the XBOX Exhibition discs and even the OPS2M demo discs - or more accurately, the Official UK PlayStation 2 demo discs. Yeah, it eventually transitioned into a official PS2 magazine demo disc and then eventually onto an official UK PS3 demo disc, but we’re getting way ahead of ourselves. I miss demos. Did anyone check out the MediEvil PS4 demo? From the MediEvil PS4 trailer? I even did a MediEvil remake review that you can see on the card in the video. You know, it you really want to see a slightly older MediEvil PS4 review. Anyway, as I said at the start of this demo disc video description, this video took me a LONG time to make. 12 hours of footage and over 200 individual trailer/gameplay demos I recorded, and here we are with a MASSIVE 32 minute review about the brilliance of PS Demo Discs. Hope you enjoy it, it surely was a journey for me.

I do. But I equally remember the magic - or more accurately, strangeness - of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine, which is where the PS1 demo discs and even PS2 demo discs came from in the first place if you lived in the UK. There was a US edition, plenty of spin offs and unofficial magazines, and even alternatives for other consoles like Nintendo Power, but this isn’t them, and you aren’t watching AVGN. Angry Video Game Nerd, sorry. Reading a PS1 magazine or a PS2 magazine was like reading your favourite book, if somebody kept on updating it because of new information. This magazine not only hid all of the classic PS1 demo discs that I talked about in my demo disc review video, but ended up becoming the best selling gaming magazine IN THE WORLD by 1999 after featuring a Metal Gear Solid review and Metal Gear Solid demo. The success never reached those levels again, but the magazine itself is still going today and managed to survive through the dawn of the internet, eventually ending up into the Official PS3 Magazine and nowadays the Official PS4 Magazine. I’m saying ‘official’ a lot because I think it’s important to stress that this wasn’t a third party magazine - it was Sony licensed, and as the magazine transitioned from PS1 to PS2, I’m surprised it was still Sony approved. Like any time a franchise or product reaches its highest sales volumes ever, this also means sales eventually do drop - and when this happens, to try to recreate initial high sales volumes in the early years, sometimes you end up completely losing it and forgetting what made you so successful in the first place. I bring this up due to what ends up happening to the Official PlayStation magazine - form the PS1 to PS2, it slowly became an adult-oriented and sleazy magazine for lads in a desperate attempt to reinvigorate the hardcore fans and bring in more casual people than ever. You won’t believe what you see towards the end of this video, and won’t believe this was an official publication from the heads of PlayStation themselves. Hotlines galore, inappropriate comments, weird articles, gross pictures, it’s got it all. Get ready for my longest video yet, grab your popcorn, and let’s look at these pages with our mouths gaping open together. Rate Your Mate, indeed. Welcome to the Caddicarus PlayStation magazine review, featuring Metal Gear Solid, Hideo Kojima, Abe’s Odyssey, Abe’s Exoddus, Jak and Daxter, Heart of Darkness, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Enter the Matrix, Rascal, Tekken, and plenty of really old Nokia mobile phone ads for Java games and ringtones of early 2000’s hits.\n\n\nCaddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo\n\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos\n\nKevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = http://incompetech.com\n\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = https://www.youtube.com/SuperOllyRoss\n\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my PS1 Magazine review and PS2 Magazine review on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n#PlayStation #Gaming #PlayStationMagazine"

Thanks to all who helped/played with me on my WoW Classic journey (390 hours of gametime) and here's to the next review! Edit: I said \"TBC second expansion\" obviously I meant after the base game. So it in reality is the first expansion, but I guess my brain counted the first iteration too? Edit Edit: People are mentioning my raid logs (from virgin playthroughs) as if it's some gotcha moment, so I linked it here for posterity. FYI not only were they virgin playthrough (no prep, no guides, no reviews) I did them with subpar gear (which you can see in the video, my bow for example was https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12651/blackcrow). https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/grobbulus/grashka \n\nB**TY B*Y\n\nReview Intro - 6:05\nReview Rubric/Grading  Explained - 6:06\nWoW Classic Introduction - 9:00 \nTime Spent Playing - 13:00\nReview Starts - 14:01\n27:00 - \"Inferiorating vs Infuriating\"\n\nRubric \"General Score\"\n================\nCombat/Gameplay\nWorld/Atmosphere\nGraphics/Art\nCommunity\n\"Massive\" \n\nRubric \"Personal Game Score\"\n=================\nLeveling\nGroup Dungeons/Raids\nPVP\nRoleplay\nCommunity\n\n\nVideos Explaining WoW Classic: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-18XgsnvNQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qpT8DRTUrc\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxngoiY-c1k\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySE9lhIZ-4s\n\nMerch: https://teespring.com/stores/nerdslayer-merch\r\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/nerdslayer\r\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/?tag=nerdslayerg-20\r\nHumble Bundle:https://www.humblebundle.com/monthly?partner=nerdslayer\r\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/nerdslayerrr\r\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/nerdslayerg\r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/xrSvSbB\r\n\r\n#DOAG . Death of a Game is a series dedicated to uncovering the mysteries surrounding the death of a game or company. nerdSlayer defines the term \"death\" in the context of the show as either... 1. Literally dead. 2. Had a mass exodus of players and never recovered (expectations etc). 3. The company ceased to exist. We follow a timeline of events, to uncover clues concerning why a game or company doesn't do well, and attempt to put it all together at the end for a deduction explaining how or why the game failed based on the evidence gathered."

        "description": "TWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/thelukeler\nThis is the full critique of Assassins Creed Odyssey and all of its DLC. This was a project that took over a year to finish and the excessive length of this video, I think, is evidence to that effect. Originally, this was uploaded as three separate videos, months and months apart, but now that all three parts are done, I’ve congealed them into one giant mass which is this monstrosity to which you’re about to bear witness. I’ve done this so that you can consume the whole critique in the way that was originally intended. I’ve still included timestamps below and I encourage you to jump around to the discussions that interest you most, or watch the whole thing start to finish, I won’t judge. This video is broadly broken into three parts, Narrative, Gameplay, and then the DLC, and there are sub discussions throughout. I get really detailed in here so if you’re looking for something very light, this isn’t the video for you. But then again, you probably didn’t click on this video unless you had some idea of what an almost 3 hour critique on a single game would bring. Lastly, I repeat it in each of the three parts, but spoiler warning. Everything in the game and its DLC will be spoiled, so consider yourself warned.\n\nThank you all for your support through this endeavour and especially to all of you Patrons that have helped make these crazy projects possible.

        "description": "Please consider supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GVMERS\r\n\nOf all the video game series that have made their mark on the industry, few have elicited as many disparate reactions as Grand Theft Auto. To some, the series is the apex of interactive media; the ultimate expression of virtual freedom, and the cathartic chaos that this freedom can result in. To others, it’s one of the biggest smoking guns behind all of the misanthropy and violence present in today’s youth, in addition to being a vile and artless product in its own right.\n\nIf there’s one aspect that nearly everyone agrees on, it’s that Grand Theft Auto is among the most successful properties in the history of its medium. In the two decades that it’s graced consoles, handhelds and PCs, the open world series has remained a fixture on most sales charts, with its most recent entry, Grand Theft Auto V, having generated more revenue by itself than most franchises manage over their entire lifetime. \n\nTo most gamers today, this thoroughness with which the series currently dominates the industry is as normal as Mario is Italian. Yet to those that have been paying attention to it since its inception, it’s still a mighty impressive feat. For up until the late 2000s, a day didn’t seem to go by where the series wasn’t embroiled in some sort of scandal created by its most egregious detractors – or its very own developers.\n\nThis is the history of Grand Theft Auto.\n\r\nSupport the channel by becoming a member:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/GVMERS/join\r\n\r\nSubscribe to GVMERS:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=GVMERS\r\n\r\nFollow GVMERS on Twitter:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/GVMERS_\r\n\r\nLike GVMERS on Facebook:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GVMERS\r\n\r\nJoin the GVMERS Discord channel:\r\nhttps://discord.gg/sZApcwx\r\n\r\nSubscribe to the GVMERS subreddit: \r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GVMERS/"

I had a huge amount to say about this game and, despite this videos long length, I ended up cutting a huge amount of the notes I’d made and also had to be very selective with what to include. In the end I focused on what seemed most important to me: the game’s biggest flaws and its most underappreciated strengths. The end result is that I spend roughly an equal amount of time in this video criticizing the witcher 3 as I do praising it, but it’s not because I dislike the game as much as I like it. I love the witcher 3, and I hope that even if this video is heavy with criticism that it still feels like a celebration of this game, because it was very much intended to be."

        "description": "Come by and say hi! https://discord.gg/HfZCueX\r\nSupport the channel https://www.patreon.com/CharlatanWonder\r\n\nImmersive sims are some of the best video game out there: System Shock, Bioshock, Thief, Dishonored, and a ton of others like “best PC game of all time” Deus Ex. Immersive sims come from a small family of game developers, most of which stemmed from Origin Systems or Looking Glass/Irrational games under the direction of gaming icons such as Warren Spector, Ken Levine, and Raphael Colontiano. Nearly all subsequent studios can trace their staff back to these studios and creators which is absolutely surreal.\r\n\nDespite being a category of games that have a penchant for sweeping game awards shows and being nothing less than Iconic (we are still making Deus Ex memes nearly 20 years since it came out, aren’t we?) the immersive sim has had some rough patches and creating them is a long, hard process that can eat studios alive. Just look at what happened to poor Troika Games when they made Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines. Most studios that make immersive sims tend to fold on themselves but the devs that make them always get back together to make more great games.\r\n\nSo what will become of Immersive Sims and the future of great games? Well, while the last few years haven’t been kind with the Deus Ex sequel cancelled, the system shock reboot rebooted, and the promising Atomic Heart being locked in turmoil, the future is full of hope. Within the next couple years we’re getting Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, System Shock 3, Bioshock 3 (or is it Bioshock 4? Game series naming conventions can get weird), and whatever the heck Ken Levine has been working on for the last 6 years. The only way for us to know is to stay tune, and play the games.\r\n\nHere’s a list of all the games that are featured in this video with links to standalone videos I’ve done on them if you’d like to learn more about that game in particular.

        "description": "Days gone is one of the most confusing games I have ever played. Not confusing in its gameplay or story, but in the fact that it's way better than it seems. In other words, if I had to briefly explain my feelings towards Days Gone, I'd say that it's the worst best game I've played in a long time. This may seem needlessly vague and confusing but that's honestly representative of how I feel. So much of this game is great, but it has a HUGE presentation problem. It's like a supermodel walking down the runway but she keeps tripping and ruining what would otherwise be a fantastic presentation. All that being said, I think Days Gone is worth a playthrough, with several caveats. I played through the game on a PS4 Slim and the God of War edition of the PS4 Pro. The game ran significantly better on the pro, so much so that switching back to the slim was quite jarring. Please understand that the technical issues in Days Gone are omnipresent and won't go away just because you have a Pro, but they are reduced. If you're wondering what kind of technical issues I'm talking about, don't worry, I'm going to go in depth on those issues towards the end of the video, but to avoid spoilers I'll just say this: Days gone is a blast, but limps along its excessive main quest line without much focus or determination. The average person's 40 hour run is well worth it just for the last 10 or so hours. But be warned, if you have trouble ignoring or adapting to frame drops and glitches in general, you'll likely become overly frustrated with the game before you get there. If it were polished, it would be in the running for GOTY, but here's the thing, it isn't. People come to my videos to see if a game is worth playing and to hear honestly what its value, strengths and weaknesses are. I have a duty to be honest. My instinct is to just recommend the game because I enjoyed it and call it a day. But I'd be doing YOU a disservice were I to do that. All of this is because after two runs and over 80 hours, I can safely say that the game should be about half the length it is. Buckle in, we're gunna break down the full game starting...

For several years, Death Stranding was the game I had most looked forward towards. In the current AAA gaming landscape - dominated by the usual gameplay ideas and familiar settings - Death Stranding sparked a feeling of curiosity I had rarely felt before. The big question obviously being: Could it possibly live up to expectations and deliver something truly unique?\n\nThis video is split up into two parts. Part 1 is a spoiler-free discussion, mainly centered around gameplay and exploring some of the biggest topics of conversation, like whether the game is actually fun to play or not and if it has managed to create a new genre through its social strand system. Part 2 is a spoiler-filled story analysis, in which I talk about and explain some of the overarching themes and general thoughts about the plot from beginning to end. You will be warned midway through the video itself, so people who haven't beaten the game can choose to hold off watching it for now. I really hope you'll enjoy hearing my thoughts.\n\nEdited by Josh Anderson - https://twitter.com/Josh_J_Anderson"

In order to save herself, and indeed, all of humanity, she must battle her way through a demon-infested castle summoned by Gebel, her old friend whose body and mind has become more crystal than flesh.\n\n\nWHAT'S IN THE GAME?\n13 FREE DLCs via future content updates. “Speed Demon” Update containing Speed Run Mode, Boss Rush Mode and the Pure Miriam outfit available at launch!\n\nAddictingly tight and satisfying gameplay alongside a rich new story in the gothic dark fantasy style of Koji Igarashi, the celebrated godfather of \"Igavania\" games.\n\nStory cut scenes and NPC interactions fully voice acted by a star-studded cast, including actors like David Hayter, Ray Chase and Erica Lindbeck to name just a few. (Seriously, we have a lot of voice acting star power in this game, it's kinda nuts...)\n\nThree playable characters, two of which have yet to be revealed...\n\nLiterally a metric ton of weapons and spells, which you can upgrade, level up and visually customize.\n\nBeautiful 2.5D graphics: 3D models crafted with a lot of love and care on a 2D game environment. That means lots of cool tricks that \"regular\" 2D can't do...\n\n\nTHE FUTURE\nExpect a worryingly large amount of announcements and updates, everything from updating the look of this Steam page to the game in general. It's going to be one wild ride.\n\n---\n\nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/692850/Bloodstained_Ritual_of_the_Night/\n\n---\n\nSUBSCRIBE!  ►  http://bit.ly/29Kriag\nCheck out my gameplay channel!  ►  http://bit.ly/29R7Ckf\nFollow me on Twitter!  ►  https://twitter.com/ingeniousclown\nFollow me on Twitch!  ►  http://www.twitch.tv/ingeniousclown\n\n#bloodstained #metroidvania #critique"

Death of a Game is a series dedicated to uncovering the mysteries surrounding the death of a game or company. nerdSlayer defines the term \"death\" in the context of the show as either... 1. Literally dead. 2. Had a mass exodus of players and never recovered (expectations etc). 3. The company ceased to exist. We follow a timeline of events, to uncover clues concerning why a game or company doesn't do well, and attempt to put it all together at the end for a deduction explaining how or why the game failed based on the evidence gathered.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070707220343/http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/358/358588p1.html\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dPIrM.png\nhttp://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/mmo-populations-1998-2013.png\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20051103071638/http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/358/358588p4.html\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20051103071638/http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/358/358588p4.html\nhttps://lineage2.fandom.com/wiki/Updates\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/2003/05/23/e3-2003-lineage-2\nhttps://www.mmorpg.com/lineage-2/news/lineage-2-goes-open-beta-march-28th-1000001392\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060427005783/en/NCsoft-Celebrates-Lineage-IIs-Anniversary-New-Game-Time\nhttps://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lineage-ii-the-chaotic-chronicle-review/1900-6099783/\nhttps://www.ign.com/articles/2004/06/19/lineage-2-the-chaotic-chronicle\nhttp://pc.gamespy.com/pc/lineage-ii-the-chaotic-chronicle/519680p1.html\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20060427005783/en/NCsoft-Celebrates-Lineage-IIs-Anniversary-New-Game-Time\nhttps://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/ncsoft-europe-expands-lineage-ii-service-in-europe\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZCauuunlG4\nhttps://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/lineage-ii-chronicle-5-oath-of-blood-b\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20080910006171/en/NCsoft-Announces-Formation-NC-West\nhttps://www.wired.com/2010/08/lineage11-addiction/\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2011/04/28/goddess-of-destruction-expansion-brings-big-changes-to-lineage-i/\nhttps://www.pcinvasion.com/lineage-2-going-fully-free-to-play/\nhttp://global.ncsoft.com/global/ir/quarterly.aspx?BID=&BC=&BNo=&SYear=&SType=&SWord=&PNo=8\nhttps://www.gamerbraves.com/lineage-ii-revolution-global-version-now-available-stores\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/lineage-2-classic-brings-back-old-time-mmoing-in-october/\nhttps://sensortower.com/blog/lineage-2-revolution-revenue-december-2018\nhttps://venturebeat.com/2018/12/09/how-lineage-2-revolution-topped-30-million-global-players/\nhttps://massivelyop.com/2019/08/06/lineage-2-korea-announces-the-arrival-of-the-death-knight-on-august-14/\nhttps://lineage2.plaync.com/events/2019/190731_deathknight/intro?keywd=L2_deathknight_1000x644_20190731&logger_kw=L2_deathknight_1000x644_20190731&source=logger_kw&_C_=4629\nhttps://www.pocketgamer.biz/asia/news/71535/ncsoft-unveils-lineage-2m-during-press-conference-in-seoul/"

The video follows the games more than it follows my linear journey across the landscape. Where no geographic equivalent to a location could be found, I tried to find a spiritual equivalent. When I couldn't do either I typically left it out.\n\nThis represents my best possible attempt to find the intersection of fact and fiction in the Fallout universe. \n\n___TABLE OF CONTENTS___\n\nIntroduction-- 0:20\n\nFallout 1-- 3:26\n\nFallout 2-- 27:54\n\nFallout: New Vegas-- 46:59\n\n\n============================\nIf you enjoyed this video and want to contribute to the production of others like it, please consider donating through the crowdfunding website Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/noahcaldwellgervais"

But how did something get THIS bad?\n\nHow does a project with so much at stake go so wrong in such a profound, all-encompassing way? At moment when the comic-book superhero genre is at its zenith, BATMAN V SUPERMAN was seemingly holding a winning hand: A celebrated, stylish director. A powerhouse cast. 80+ years worth of cherished American pop-mythology to draw from. Some of the most popular characters of all time. Dumptrucks full of Warner Bros' money to spend. And on top of all that, a moviegoing public hungry enough for an alternative to the Marvel Cinematic Universe formula for a pitch like \"depressing, ultra-violent, pitch-dark 9/11-themed SUPERMAN movie\" to sound (almost) like a good idea.\n\nAnd yet, the end result was among the great cinematic calamities of the last decade; receiving scathing reviews, a near record-setting box-office dropoff, enraged notices from many fans and sarcastic \"thank you's\" from people named Martha. Even today, the shockwave from the film's negative reception are being felt as the studio continues to reshuffle the slate of films it was meant to inspire, JUSTICE LEAGUE continues to be transformed in post-production and the word \"reboot\" begins to fill the air. While not unprofitable or without its own unironic fans, the film seems destined to go down as one of the most infamous releases in the history of the genre.\n\nIn this first of two episodes comprising the first (and only) \"BAD\" installment of the \"REALLY THAT GOOD\" series, we revisit the basics of the film's all-encompassing missteps - from a terrible screenplay to a poorly-structured story to hideously ugly visuals to a seemingly willful hatred for its audience and subject matter - while also answering many (and I mean MANY) of the most common \"defenses\" of one of the worst superhero films ever made; laying the groundwork for deeper and more nuanced deconstruction to come in PART 2.\n\n\"Black Vortex\", \"Disco Lounge\", \"Marty Gots a Plan\", \"Oppressive Gloom\", \"The Curtain Rises\", \"Ultralounge\", \"Wizardtorium,\" \"Inspire\"\nKevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...\n\nSome FX footage courtesy:\nFootage Island\nRoyalty Free Tube\n\nBATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE is a licensed property of Warner Bros Pictures.\n\nREALLY THAT BAD is a work of film/media criticism created for education and journalism purposes and makes no claims on any media that is discussed in any individual episode."

And to make this a reality they called upon classic elements like Jobs, Chocobos, Moogles and they centered everything around a compelling narrative that would be based in the expansive realm of Vana'diel.\n\n►KEY POINTS WITHIN THIS FINAL FANTASY XI RETROSPECTIVE\n\n1.

        "description": "https://linktr.ee/cgquarterly\n\nEpisode 61 - The Launch of the Sega Dreamcast.  Sega may have been playing with the big boys in the early 90’s, but the middle third of the decade saw the American side of the company fall far and fast.  Genesis games were starting to look aged compared to Nintendo’s 16-bit offerings, and while maybe a good idea in theory, the 32X did more harm than good.  Sega of Japan made the rash decision to launch the Saturn early and overpriced in the US, and to say that it struggled against the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation would be putting it mildly.  Bernie Stolar joined and later led Sega of America, and although almost universally hated by gamers, he helped ease the dying Saturn into the grave and ready Sega’s next generation hardware.  The Dreamcast was launched on September 9, 1999, a.k.a. “9/9/99”, and a massive 19 games joined it on store shelves.  Sonic Adventure, NFL 2K, and SoulCalibur were easily the marquee day one games, but other launch games, including Hydro Thunder, Power Stone, NFL Blitz 2000, and Expendable are still great to play even today.\n\nSupport CGQ on Patreon - http://www.patreon.com/cgquarterly\nGet your CGQ Schwag - http://www.cgquarterly.com/shopcgq\nJoin the channel to make a small monthly contribution right here on YouTube!  https://bit.ly/2WkqAWu\n\nIf you’d like access to the official CGQ Discord server, shoot me an e-mail (address below) for an invite link.\n\n- All VGA-compatible games were captured at 1280x960 using a Retro Access Dreamcast 576i/480p cable, an OSSC upscaler, and a Startech USB 3.0 capture card.  Interlaced signals of games not compatible with VGA were processed through a Framemeister and captured on the same device.  Take home message: 480p DC games still look damned good on modern displays.\n\n- When discussing the Dreamcast video cables, I said that the Dreamcast displayed 240p and 480i through composite and s-video.  While it is true that the DC can output 480i, 576i is the more common interlaced mode.  But while not technically correct, had I said “576i” without explaining what that meant, it would have been confusing for most people. \n\n- At an hour and fifteen minutes, this is the longest video on the main channel, including the unscripted magazine read-throughs.  It is roughly twice the length of the next longest launch video, the Sega Master System.\n\n- Speaking of length, the script for this episode is 10,164 words and 16 pages long.  The next longest script was “The Sega Genesis in 1990”, at 8,834 words.\n\n- If at one point in the video you got startled, you were supposed to.\n\n- I think the NFL Blitz 2000 segment is too long, but at the same time I wouldn't know how to cut it down.  I find it impossible to play that game without a smile on my face.  \"THAT WAS AN ILLEGAL HIT!\"  Check it out if you've never played it.\n\n- “NAMCO” was literally the first shot that I knew that I wanted in this video.  \n\n- Try playing the new “Classic Gaming Quarterly Eating Game”.  Every time I say “meat & potatoes”, you have to eat some meat & potatoes.\n\n- This is my favorite-ever ending to one of my videos.  I feel like the last few bits of the video are a downer because I mention the ultimate fate of the Dreamcast and of Sega, so the ending was a way to celebrate the good times.\n\nAlso be sure to check out my other channel, where I do live streams, nostalgic musings about childhood in the 80's, and even the occasional collection video.  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/cgqplus\n\nSend me a post card and I’ll send you one back:\nClassic Gaming Quarterly\nPO Box 73126\nDavis, CA 95617\n\nShow e-mail: cgquarterly@gmail.com\n\nSocial Media Links\nhttp://twitter.com/CGQuarterly\nhttp://www.instagram.com/cgquarterly/\n\nOfficial CGQ Facebook group:https://bit.ly/2J8u5M4\nhttp://www.cgquarterly.com\n\n#Dreamcast20 #LaunchVids #CGQ"

Facing an unknown future, Santa Monica Studio took a massive risk, fundamentally changing their beloved franchise and re-establishing their rightful place in video game history.  \n\nMore than just a “making of,” this cinematic journey of second chances rooted in family, sacrifice, struggle and doubt follows game director Cory Barlog and those who chase perfection in art and storytelling.  Witness the incredible defeats, the unpredictable outcomes and the down-to-the-wire tension on full display in this true life redemption story."

Death of a Game is a series dedicated to uncovering the mysteries surrounding the death of a game or company. nerdSlayer defines the term \"death\" in the context of the show as either... 1. Literally dead. 2. Had a mass exodus of players and never recovered (expectations etc). 3. The company ceased to exist. We follow a timeline of events, to uncover clues concerning why a game or company doesn't do well, and attempt to put it all together at the end for a deduction explaining how or why the game failed based on the evidence gathered.\n\nSources: \n\nhttp://www.hawkengame.com/blog/archives/75\nhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/03/10/robot-rock-hawken-is-quite-the-indie-game/\nhttps://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/hawken\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120830041559/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game/posts/296537 \nhttp://hawken.mirror.ashfire908.com/topic/11547-all-pilots-to-their-mechs-open-beta-is-live/\n https://www.geekwire.com/2012/meteor-raises-18m-attract-10-million-players-online-shooter-game-hawken/\n https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/12/31/impressions-hawkens-open-beta/\nhttps://www.pcgamesn.com/hawken/hawken-ascension-update-beginning-new-age-and-monumental-piece-work-now-live\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/news/?appids=271290&enddate=1393660800&appgroupname=HAWKEN&feed=steam_release\nhttps://www.geekwire.com/2014/meteor-entertainment-ceo-mark-long-steps-seattle-office-closes/\nhttps://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-16-people-behind-apb-reloaded-buy-hawken\nhttps://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/06/27/hawken-launches-july-8-on-ps4/\nhttps://archive.fo/20171006205710/https://steamcommunity.com/games/271290/announcements/detail/1258040211271031199\nhttps://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-10-03-hawken-studio-kills-pc-edition-to-refocus-development-efforts\nhttps://www.playhawken.com/server-status/xbox\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Hawken/comments/9kuzui/hawken_private_server_pc\nhttps://www.pcgamesn.com/hawken/hawken-shutdown\nhttps://www.pcgamer.com/hawken-review/\nhttps://steamcharts.com/app/271290#All\n\nDeath of a Game: Hawken"

Platformers were all the rage during the 80s, yet Mechner’s set itself apart from its contemporaries with its weighty, swashbuckling action, and incredibly smooth animations – a feat that Mechner had achieved by rotoscoping his family and friends into sprites.\n\nAfter a decade of enhanced ports and a strong sequel, the series would fall into an abyss following a misstep into the third dimension. Yet just when all seemed lost, Ubisoft’s young, Montreal-based studio would step in and transform the series into a modern classic, implementing a gameplay mechanic now as iconic as the franchise itself in the process.  \n\nPrince of Persia’s new heroes would continue to nurture it for many years after – until finally, after bringing it to the silver screen, the decision was made to put it on hold. The series’ spark had seemingly vanished – but the mark it had left on the industry and gamers worldwide would still remain. \n\nThis is the rise and fall of Prince of Persia.\n\n#princeofpersia \n\nSupport the channel by becoming a member:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/GVMERS/join\n\nSubscribe to GVMERS:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=GVMERS\n\nFollow @GVMERS on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/GVMERS\n\nLike GVMERS on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GVMERS\n\nJoin the GVMERS Discord channel:\nhttps://discord.gg/sZApcwx\n\nSubscribe to the GVMERS subreddit: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GVMERS/"

In fact, they were so important that games companies were employing the likes of Koichi Sugiyama, one of Japan’s most respected classical composers to give the 8-bit and 16-bit sound a sophistication never heard before. In this episode, we follow the music of Final Fantasy as the compositions of Nobuo Uematsu come full circle. In their early incarnations, it was 8-bit music imitating the orchestral sound.

        "description": "In 1997, a video game company named Bohemia Interactive was established in Prague. The Czech Republic had historically never been a hotbed for video game development, but Bohemia’s founders – Marek Španěl, Ondřej Španěl, and Slavomír Pavlíček – were on a mission. They were determined to create a first person shooter that would capture the reality of war more accurately than any game before it; an engrossing simulation that would depict what real battlefields were like, and feature an unprecedented sense of scale and attention to detail. \n\nAfter a challenging and prolonged development period, Bohemia delivered on these ambitions in 2001 with Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. The game was both a triumph within the genre of tactical first-person shooters, and one of the first major successes in the history of Czech-made video games. But it was also beginning of two wars – a war between Bohemia and its publisher, which would attempt to capitalize on the game without its creators’ involvement, and a war between Bohemia and itself, as the studio struggled to balance its ambitions with its capabilities. \nWhen the dust finally settled over a decade later, Operation Flashpoint had been stripped of its appeal and future. But Bohemia had survived, and started a new series, ARMA, that picked up mechanically and spiritually where Cold War Crisis left off. Unlike its predecessor, ARMA received a more muted reaction from the industry when it debuted – yet eventually grew into an empire within the military simulation genre.\n\nIn a world where abandoned video game franchises so rarely receive spiritual successors that continue in their footsteps, the story of the Operation Flashpoint and ARMA is a shining exception; a reminder that not all inactive series become lost forever.\n\nThis is the rise and fall of Operation Flashpoint.\n\nVideo sources:\n\ngamescom 2012: Interview with Marek Spanel from Bohemia Interactive: https://youtu.be/HorSqsUfxic\nEnzait DayZ Cinematics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKUi12O7i8w\nReportáž - Nové informace o hře Carrier Command: Gaea Mission: https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/1095870977-game-page/212563242600003/obsah/190949-reportaz-nove-informace-o-hre-carrier-command-gaea-mission/\nReportáž - Carrier Command: Gaea Mission: https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/1095870977-game-page/210572242600006/obsah/106349-reportaz-carrier-command-gaea-mission\nBohemia Interactive — Game Page — iVysílání — Česká televize: https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ivysilani/1095870977-game-page/209572242600010/obsah/75796-bohemia-interactive\nGame Page — Česká televize: https://www.ceskatelevize.cz/porady/1095870977-game-page/211563242600014/?clanek=720\nB.L.O.U.D. for the Atari 8-bit: family: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EydLuhQnpQc\nDon't mess with Texas - TI-99/4A Megademo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhSUhE03XFw\nConvoy Simulation Training part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Ngq1Jj88c\n\nPlease consider supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/GVMERS\n\nSubscribe to GVMERS:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=GVMERS\n\nFollow @GVMERS on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/GVMERS\n\nLike GVMERS on Facebook:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GVMERS\n\nJoin the GVMERS Discord channel:\nhttps://discord.gg/sZApcwx\n\nSubscribe to the GVMERS subreddit: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GVMERS/"

This was one of the first videos I ever loved making despite having to use Sony Vegas, which by the way crashed 5 times during production. I never believed a simple expansion pack like this could be so important. To the series, to my understanding of the games and to these videos. There's lots of points I didn't get to cover in this video for the sake of structure which I'm really quite proud of in this case. I highly recommend you play the game yourself, just makes sure you buy the steam version! And know you'll need to download the 64 bit patch if you have windows 10.\n\nFor music I just used the full Warhead album. It's a great soundtrack. The track you hear during the conclusion is from Crysis 2, called \"nano catalyst prophet's journey\". \n\nI apologise for the bitrate of the footage. I recorded at 20mb/s and rendered at 20 too. It came out better than the first video at least. Much of that's down to Vegas' awful renderer but also because I can't record PC games at high fidelity. Not until I get some returns from this channel at least.\n\nTwitter: @thelightiswhite"

        "description": "Need for Speed Payback was the second installment of this cycle of Need for Speed games. It was expected to fix it's predecessor's failures, and bring the franchise back from years of mediocrity. Finally, it's time to find out if Payback was yet another black mark in a series of failures, or the light at the end of the tunnel that we all want it to be.\n\nHere's my thoughts as to how the design of Payback makes the cars feel slow. I said in the video the physics play their part, but as with all open world racers, the physics and the road are tightly linked. The problem is one part that the roads are too forgiving. You go off in payback, you can drive back on only losing a second or two thanks to the open space and relatively quick driving physics. Unlike any other NFs where going off would usually be a serious crash. Even when you do crash in payback, it's like a 3 second halt. This means there's no fear in the players mind when they put their foot down. You aren't scared that you might crash off if you go too fast. You feel no risk in going as fast as possible. Then there's the smoothness of the roads to consider. They're like butter, and when you combine that with how little the cars bounce, high speed doesn't significantly force you to increase the rate of your inputs to course correct. Going 200 something mph in a game like Driveclub would require you to go like barry allen on the stick to keep yourself straight, or the inconsistency of the roads are going to send you into low earth orbit. Payback lacks all of these traits. A point I didn't raise in the video is the true extent of \"kinda\". The physics kinda match the roads, but really, it's still not great. There's quite a lot of open road in Payback and while the physics are closer to hot pursuit's to match that, they aren't close enough to make it fun enough. The live tuning doesn't make large enough changes for you to ever come near the spec you'd want to take on Payback's desert roads properly.\n\nA clarification as to what I meant regarding the pay to win stuff. Payback shockingly isn't pay to win. You carry the base cars into multiplayer but not the speed cards. I think. I haven't messed around with it."

        "description": "The result of two weeks of blood and sweat. I enjoyed making this one, and I hope you enjoy watching it. Crysis 2 deserves it. I have to thank Raycevick or Cuhnadian for inspiring this video's format. I also have to thank game movies for making a Crysis 2 cutscene compilation that was a godsend for my hard drive. I may or may not have promised a video on every game in the series. It’s a good thing at the time of uploading, I’ve only got Warhead to play through. Crysis 3 is going to be a difficult one to write. Stay tuned \nfor that.\n\nTwitter: @thelightiswhite\n\nAs for the extra notes: \n\nThis game had a slightly ridiculous amount of intro sequences. Crysis 2 has 3. 3 fookin cutscenes, not including the long ass recovery segment. You’ve got the prototype style city is going to hell compilation, then the character introductions, then the badass intro we all came for. With totally jarring cuts in between each. Personally, I’d remove the prototype stuff, and have the badass intro come right off the character building. \n\nCrysis 2 deserves every GOTY award just for using the word catalyst correctly. \n\nPoor tutorialisation of maximum armour. The game tells you it’s for surviving explosions, and while that’s true, it never gives the impression that it’s much good against small arms. Cloak is done much better. The player will assume that cloak is the best option for traversing levels, but in reality, guns blazing is just as good. Armour is highly effective against every attack cells or low level ceph has, and it’s use is pretty much necessary for survival. \n\nPacing is fucking great. You get the slow and steady build up at the start with getting to gould, then the set up and mystery with the aliens and hargreave, then the balls to the walls military action with Barclay.\n\nDual wielding is absent. Why? Don’t know. Seems like a pointless removal. The m12 nova is the basic pistol, and it is utterly useless due to the lack of dual wielding. The Hammer and Majestic seem just fine on their own though. (END OF NOTES)\n\nMusic I think went really well in this video. Unsurprisingly, it’s a big help when a game’s soundtrack is that damn good. But this was a 50 minutes video, so that meant half the soundtrack needed to sound cool AND fit what I was talking about. That meant I needed to repeat tracks and use remixes or covers I found off youtube.\n\nThe piano cover of Crysis 2’s theme comes from DuskPiano. The original cover link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxWSg5knFk\n\nAnd the synthesia version you heard in the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyk-tRJ8KYE\n\nThe hip hop beat version that people have actually rapped to comes from Endi. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_4hDXzCiOU. I can’t believe this sounded as good as it did. \n\nLinks to stuff straight from the ost:\n\nMain theme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy4iQvJo24U\n\nWhat are you prepared to sacrifice? This is from Crysis 3, Slavov made a much more emotional OST and I think it fit in well: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XcYFsK8R9k\n\nNew York Memories (Also from Crysis 3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF4GS6BJNpk\n\nUnder Siege: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSLM_pi_Olo. I think I overused this one.\n\nSOS New York: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnCp6c8F4K4. This is the dramatic one from the intro.\n\nNanosuit 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iA_lwFaSLAY\n\nNano catalyst and Prophet’s journey: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXbQUJbckZM. This is from the second dramatic transition.\n\nRampage suite: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOTnGG_RWR8. I used this for a tiny section after the plot summary.\n\nThat covers it."

        "description": "Welcome to Crysis 10 Years Later. I hope you enjoy(ed) it. As I said, I already have videos on Crysis 2 and 3 (And my recently released Destiny 2 critique!), so if you'd like to learn more on the franchise, there's that. I used the popular \"Years Later\" format because I thought it was most appropriate for covering these games, I was always going to cover them. I am also Raycevick's brother. Some stuff I say on the story is also in my Destiny 2 video, but it's actually a reverse reuse, I made the argument for Crysis, and happened to use it Destiny first. \n\nTwitter: @thelightiswhite\n\nCrysis also had a console port the same year C2 came out. Console version combined strength and speed. Decreases skill cap, but speeds the game up. Not a fan. It rips some visual effects from Crysis 2 such as the maximum armour effect, general tightening up, but less foliage due to low RAM on consoles. AI also take a downgrade, the not reacting bug seems to be a huge issue. VTOL mission is removed. Why? Surely the controller would have fixed the control issues that people complained about? No multiplayer. It's a fair port, nothing to write home about\n\nLink to Comic: http://readcomiconline.to/Comic/Crysis\n\nAs for the music, I use Crysis 1's contact for the intro, and some Crysis Warhead stuff for the story. Warhead's soundtrack is only 30 mins, so I used over a third of it in this video. As for the rest, it's all Crysis 2 stuff, excellent soundtrack, you can find the direct link and listings in my Crysis 2 video."

        "description": "Apologies for the video quality. I have Titanfall 2 on Ps4, so that's 720p footage right out the gate. Add rendering and youtube compression and you get this. RIP.\n\nAmmendments: I gave Drydock too much praise. I Don't think it's on the same tier as the other maps I listed. \nI read somewhere that a lot of the problems with T2's map design comes from the elevation. Titans will always be grounded, pilots\nthough are able to climb up pretty much anything. Problem is, few titanfall 2 maps have differing elevations for Pilots and\nTitans, meaning Titans dominate a lot more. \n\nAbout some things I said on the NPCs: I said they were a genius balancing mechanic. And they are. For the individual player. Not\nthe outcome of games. I don't think my originially intended comparison to Destiny or Battlefield in that regard is concrete.\nBattlefield games are regularly FAR closer than Titanfall. Its got a bit of a snowball problem. That would naturally happen with lower team sizes,\nand the NPCs fail to balance the teams effectively. Is there a way to do it right? To balance game outcomes without fucking\nwith the competetive aspects? Apparently, T2 has spawning issues, where losing teams get bad spawns consistently. I can't comment\non that. I might look in to it further.  \n\nHaving watched many a Titanfall 1 V 2 comparison video, I can safely say that T2's balancing has regressed FAR more than I realised or described in the video. I still think it's an excellent sequel, but it's very far off perfect. T3 has it's work cut out for it.\nWatch the T3 video I link below for more info. I don't agree with all the arguments in it. But I especially agree that T2's guns should\nnot be using Random Bullet Deviation, even if they still feel great.\n\nFrothy's Loadout Balance Video.

The shit list was actually cut down, loading times, debris and flares would have had entries but they got cut because I didn't have enough to say about them. \n\nThe intro music is a Battlefield 4 theme remix by the incredibly talented B4its2L8guy, whose name makes my eyes want to implode. Here's the link to his video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCSFkEBuFrU\nDownloads are free! \n\nI'd like to say one last thing about the editing of the video. It wasn't as good as previous videos I've made, and that's largely due to the fact that I can't control what happens in BF1. Everything you see is just shareplay footage from my 180 something games. It made for a pretty cool intro though! I hope."

A game that was destined for Nintendo's 64 bit mario machine, but would only ever see the light of day on the company's purple cube. You guys have been asking about this, and I just had to deliver on one of the most interesting titles in the series so far. Let's see in Resident Evil 0 can live up to the high praise that the remake of part 1 has, right here on the Resident Evil Retrospective."

Thanks to Joseph Anderson for shouting me out last video. And thanks to Raycevick for not sending a hitman after me for using his format. \n\nTwitter: @thelightiswhite\n\nI said in my review that I wanted to take a critique style format to the campaign because I felt it better suited the game, and I knew I would have enough time. Well, in truth, that's only 90% of  the reason. The other 10 comes down to soundtrack. Crysis 3's tracklist is remarkabley unremarkable. Slavov did deliver us the excellent What Are You Prepared To Sacrifice though, which, if you're here looking for music, is what you're looking for."

It soon gained a cult following within the Soviet Union. A battle for the rights to publish Tetris erupted when the game crossed the Iron Curtain. Tetris not only took the video game industry by storm, but it also helped break the boundaries between the United States and the Soviet Union. \n\nIntro - 00:00\nPart 1: Pajitnov - 01:49\nPart 2: Into the West - 10:03\nPart 3: The Red Box - 17:19\nPart 4: Enter Nintendo - 23:50\nPart 5: Capitalism - 33:38\nPart 6: Endgame - 44:12\nEnd Credits - 55:38\n\nCorrections:\nIn 1995, AcademySoft and Elorg's license to Tetris expired but Elorg had filed copyright and trademark registrations for Tetris around the world and claimed it controlled the rights to Tetris. Henk Rogers founded Blue Planet Software and partnered with Alexey Pajitnov. In 1996, Blue Planet Software and Elorg (through an affiliate) formed The Tetris Company, LLC to serve as the exclusive licensor of Tetris so that the Tetris brand could continue to be commercialized.

While I don't usually discuss major DLC releases for games that I critique, I was so interested by the latter story expansion that I decided we had to give it a shot. This video is the result of playing through the expansions for roughly 20 hours and the analysis of multiple hours of interviews done by the development team.

With Mega Man & Bass being the 9th console release in the classic Mega Man series, it became increasingly apparent to me during the scripting process how important it was to discuss the games that came before. That's why I've produced this companion video as a lead in to the MM&B review proper, complete with eight \"mini\" reviews in a lean, 20 some minute package. Mini reviews as a segment have been dead since early 2014, so I thought it might be worth reinventing them into something I would actually make relatively often.

Mega Man and Bass is often considered one of the worst Mega Man games ever made, but after getting it on a reproduction cart this past April, I felt compelled to throw my own hat into the ring. Originally release only in Japan on the Super Famicom in 1998, the game was later rereleased internationally on the Game Boy Advance in 2002 and underwent some changes worth discussing. Seeing as the GBA rerelease is the only version most North Americans have played, it becomes especially important to know the differences between the two versions and stack them up against each other. Without further ado, this is the long anticipated (and long running) episode of Mega Man and Bass!\n\nEveryone go check out my friend and one of my favorite reviewers, J's Reviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOiqB1MjAZpaq4m8WIoqQAw\n\nHere's a link to our previous Quest 4 Booty collab review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ux4OalYr1ho\n\nHere's a link to J's excellent All Inclusive Mega Man X Retrospective:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMnjnoGqME4&list=PLVpPMdR6Ba_Rr0gOkNulXzAlvfCgXpC9-\n\nCheck out Retropolis Zone's review of Mega Man X7:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeyosd7Rp3k\n\nBe sure to check out my other channels and Twitter:\n\nEPG Plays (Let's Plays and Streams):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwLQ5HiX4jPLifHVbFS0irw\n\nUnversed Cast (Podcast Channel):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaX0i-H5-gv-9PcU3MXhzWw\n\nTwitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/ExoParadigmGmr\n\nGame Mavericks (Legacy Let's Plays):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICVDVEbHNJSKDHKbl7DbMg\n\nRemake or Rebreak Scores:\n1- Rebreak: Fails to resurrect the same quality standard as the original due to incompetent design, technical failures, etc. A virtually worthless remake/port overall.\n2- Re-Meh: Not as good as the original, but a relatively competent recreation that is still very playable.

No, folks, I really don't know how I do it. This time we're looking at the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time on N64, GCN, and 3DS. How does the original game hold up today? How well does the GameCube rerelease improve upon the N64 original? What exactly does the Master Quest expansion add to the original game? Finally, how well does the 3DS remake update the game for 2011? All these questions, and more, answered in this near feature length ROR extravaganza!

In this new video in my in-depth gaming series, I discuss the whole story of the game from beginning to end. I talk about Kratos and Atreus, the side characters like Freya and Brok & Sindri. I go into all boss fights with Baldur, Magni and Modi and the Dragon. Last but not least, I also discuss the ending, Blades of Chaos, Thor & Loki reveal, and what this can all mean for the next God of War game. Whether on PlayStation 4 or PS5, God of War 2 will undoubtedly have a lot for us in store. I wouldn't exactly call it an analysis of the full game, more a video about reliving the experience and how it made me feel, sort of like a spoilercast. Nonetheless, it's a video I've worked on for weeks, and I hope you can tell how much effort I've put into this video based on its quality. Thanks a lot for watching!"

It would be non-sensical if I did, because among its target audience, I believe Postal has done quite well for itself. You are right that Postal has niche appeal, and for a niche product I think it has been quite successful. Besides, as I am not an employee of RWS, and receive no monetary reward for that article, or for sales of any Postal title, I had no reason to express resent over the success or failure of Postal as a product. I wrote the article to express exactly what is written - support of gamers, and game makers, who have either gone unnoticed or antagonized by the gaming press. I know I am treading on ground where you might disagree with that, but it is sincerely where I was coming from.\n\nThere are many other inaccuracies among the claims you make, that I would have liked to tackle, but I'm not a member of RWS and I am confident that they can stand up for themselves. So I'm only here to address the instance where you used my words specifically, to paint an inaccurate picture of RWS, as being sore that (using your stated interpretation of my article) Postal isn't as successful as Depression Quest (which is obviously a ridiculous assertion, but that's what I got from your statements. Please let me know if I misinterpreted). This should be an easy fix, with a simple annotation during that segment of your video, explaining that my article isn't actually saying what you're claiming that it is. It wouldn't be too much trouble, I believe, and I would appreciate that greatly.\"\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this video and want to support the creation of others like it, please consider supporting me through Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/noahcaldwellgervais"

        "description": "This video is not intended for those who have not played the game. Sure, you can watch it even if you haven’t but be warned that I’m going to spoil absolutely everything and in the narrative section I’m going to spoil the story of The Last of Us. The goal of this video is to analyze and critique what does and most importantly, what doesn’t work in God of War. There are videos galore discussing how incredible and amazing this game is but there are very few, if any, that seek to point out the good and bad, something crucial for honest evaluation. At times it may seem as though I’m just nitpicking, but at the end of the day, this game is fantastic. If you’re on the edge and unsure of whether you should play this game, just do it. Play it. That’s my inspiration to you. But with that said, this is not a review, it’s not a casual discussion, it’s a critique. I’m not going to describe every basic game function because the assumption is that you are already familiar with it. Basic evaluative statements like “the game looks great” and “sound design is well done” are not going to be found here. Instead, we’re going to break down the game’s story in detail all the way down to a discussion on postmodernism in modern story-telling, and of course the gameplay and what makes it tick. \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHelp fund the Show on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/LukeStephens\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTIMESTAMPS\n\nACT 1: Narrative - 2:31\nACT 2: Gameplay - 31:08\nConclusion - 42:26\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Other Channel: https://goo.gl/FsMUZy\nMain Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/LukeStephensTV\nListen To The Show On The Go! https://lukestephens.podbean.com/\n\nJoin the Discord! https://discord.gg/5ZYbXPf\n\nThank you to you all for making the show possible!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Rig:\nAsus PRIME Z270-A MoBo\ni7 7700k (Overclocked to 4.67 GHZ & watercooled)\nGTX 1070 FE (OC'd)\n32GB DDR4 RAM, 2666mhz\n1TB SSD\n4TB Barricuda HDD\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n►FaceBook: https://www.facebook.com/LukeStephensTV\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/lukestephenstv\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubscribe and I'll be your bestest friend!"

I'm making this video on April 5th 2017, one year later. Over the course of a year I played 200+ VR games, put over 1000 hours into the VR space sim game Elite: Dangerous, and bought the Oculus Rift VR headset with Oculus Touch controllers and the PlayStation VR HMD. In this video I talk about my experiences with VR using the HTC Vive over the course of a year, my thoughts on VR in general and how the VR industry has grown and VR games have changed. I also talk about some of my favorite VR games, locomotion techniques, and my thoughts on HTC Vive vs Oculus Rift vs PSVR.\n\n\nHTC Vive ($800)\nhttps://www.amazon.com/HTC-VIVE-Virtual-Reality-System-Pc/dp/B00VF5NT4I/?tag=bumble0b-20\n\nOculus Rift + Touch ($500)\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Rift-Touch-Virtual-Reality-System/dp/B073X8N1YW/?tag=bumble0b-20\n\nPlayStation VR ($400)\nhttps://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-VR/dp/B01DE9DY8S/?tag=bumble0b-20\n\nIn this video I also talked about some of the simulation accessories I use for increased VR immersion. I use a SubPac M2 subwoofer backpack to add realistic rumbling to my back in simulation games based on the bass sounds from the game. I also use a T150 force feedback steering wheel and wheel stand for driving and racing VR games, which also helps add haptic feedback. For VR flight sims and space sims, I use the x52 Pro HOTAS.\n\nFor more information on the SubPac M2, check out my review video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xvmadA7LBw\n\nSubPac M2 Wearable Physical Sound System:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/SubPac-M2-Wearable-Physical-System/dp/B0195BL4OU/?tag=bumble0b-20\n\nThrustmaster T150 Force Feedback Racing Wheel and pedals:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014US02ZA/?tag=bumble0b-20\n\nTX Deluxe Racing Steering Wheelstand:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GP3RUI6/?tag=bumble0b-20\n\nLogitech Gaming G Saitek X52 Pro Flight Controller HOTAS\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Gaming-Saitek-Flight-Controller/dp/B01LZ1MQTL/?tag=bumble0b-20\n\nIf you want a tutorial on how to modify an office chair for cheap to turn it into a flight chair for VR games like Elite: Dangerous, check out this video I made:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5xeDbYrp74\n\nThis is my video on how to troubleshooter a defective HTC Vive HDMI cable:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCqhXhHIGZM\n\nIf you want to see more virtual reality gameplay footage and reviews, check out my channel.

It marked the first attempt by Ubisoft to deliver a full narrative focused experience with, what were at the time, massive maps and action sequences. The game is set in 18th century America, specifically, during the American Revolution from 1754 to 1783. Over the course of the game we meet everyone from Ben Franklin to George Washington and help each with various tasks to help ensure America’s survival as a sovereign entity. We play as Connor, a half-British half-Mohawk warrior who is hell bent on revenge and is dedicated to saving his homeland. At face value, the game seemed to be more of the same that we had seen in the previous 4 major releases in the series; however, this couldn’t be farther from the truth.\n\nHelp fund the Show on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/LukeStephens\n\nJoin the Discord! https://discord.gg/5ZYbXPf\n\nThank you to you all for making the show possible!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Other Channel: https://goo.gl/FsMUZy\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Rig:\nAsus PRIME Z270-A MoBo\ni7 7700k (Overclocked to 4.67 GHZ & watercooled)\nGTX 1070 FE (OC'd)\n32GB DDR4 RAM, 2666mhz\n1TB SSD\n4TB Barricuda HDD\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n►FaceBook: https://www.facebook.com/LukeStephensTV\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/lukestephenstv\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubscribe and I'll be your bestest friend!"

        "description": "TWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/thelukeler\n\nWhen I first played Fallout New Vegas I hated it. I was over at my uncle’s house and my older brother queued the game up on his 360. We only had a PS2 and so the opportunity to play on a 360 was always quickly seized. My brother had been watching YouTube videos of the game and knew every part of the game inside and out. His enthusiasm was infectious, and so when I was handed the controller I was intrigued. I went through the clunky character creator segment and was, to be completely honest, immensely intimidated by the stat allocation. My brother tried to explain it to me, but I just found it confusing. Regardless, I opened the door to the Mojave and was, once again, overwhelmed. My brother explained the sheer scope of the game and showed the size of the map to me. \n     Now, prior to this, my only exposure to large open-world games had been a brief stint with Skyrim wherein I played the game for a couple dozen hours and was promptly distracted by… girls. But it wasn’t just the size of the map, but it was the scope of the game that was intimidating. And by scope I mean everything that the game tried to do:  the branching narrative, the multiple endings, the plethora of play styles supported, and of course, the romancing options, all piled up into an overwhelming behemoth that I couldn’t handle. \n      I tried running to Novac, but was incredibly annoyed by how slow the character moved and fact that I couldn’t just sprint there. I came across some bandits and couldn’t get VATS to work in my favor. And then I decided to travel to Nipton where I found a group of strangely dressed nerds who did not like it when I tried to fight them unprovoked. At this point, justifiably or not, I was done. I simply didn’t see the fun to be had in the game. It seemed to me overly complicated, clunky and lacking the 'Arcady' elements of fun that I had previously found in games like Just Cause 2 and Stronghold Crusader. \n     Now, looking back, I can see that I was not ready for the experience within New Vegas. Freshman in High School Luke was impulsive, impatient and unwilling to play the game the way it was designed. Now as I play it, I'm faced with a game that is truly phenomenal, and I can't recommend it enough.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTIME STAMPS:\n1) Gameplay - 2:09\n2) Narrative - 15:30 \n3) The Tech - 21:37\n4) Fun Factor - 24:44\n5) Conclusion - 27:26\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHelp fund the Show on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/LukeStephens\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Other Channel: https://goo.gl/FsMUZy\nMain Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/LukeStephensTV\nListen To The Show On The Go! https://lukestephens.podbean.com/\n\nJoin the Discord! https://discord.gg/5ZYbXPf\n\nThank you to you all for making the show possible!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Rig:\nAsus PRIME Z270-A MoBo\ni7 7700k (Overclocked to 4.67 GHZ & watercooled)\nGTX 1070 FE (OC'd)\n32GB DDR4 RAM, 2666mhz\n1TB SSD\n4TB Barricuda HDD\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n►FaceBook: https://www.facebook.com/LukeStephensTV\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/lukestephenstv\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSubscribe and I'll be your bestest friend!"

While it tried flipping the formula on its head by giving you control of a Templar, it fails to stick the landing.

        "description": "https://linktr.ee/cgquarterly\n\nEpisode 46 - Although the history of 3D gaming stretches all the way back to the very early 1980's, outside of the arcades it didn't start in earnest until the early 90s.  The 3DO Interactive Mulitplayer and Atari Jaguar both launched in 1993, Nintendo used the Super FX chip to create polygonal 3D games like Star Fox and Stunt Race FX on the Super Nintendo, while Sega used the SVP chip to create a home port of arcade hit Virtua Racing on the Genesis.  In 1993, Nintendo partnered with Silicon Graphics to develop their next-generation hardware, while in 1995, the release of both the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation signaled the \"real\" beginning of home 3D gaming.   After numerous delays, Nintendo finally joined the next generation of consoles, as the Nintendo 64 was launched in Japan and North America in mid 1996.  Although many gamers who grew up playing the Nintendo Entertainment System had, by the mid 90's, moved on to more \"grown-up\" systems like the Playstation and Saturn, the Nintendo 64 was a big part of the 90's childhood, and made Nintendo fanatics out of a whole new generation of gamers.\n\nCheck out Banjo Guy Ollie: http://bit.ly/2s1VhkA\n\nShow Notes:\n\n- This show took 9 months (on and off) to make. \n\n- All gameplay footage was captured using an RGB-modded Nintendo 64 upscaled through a Framemeister and recorded using an Elgato Game Capture HD.\n\nMusic courtesy of Kevin MacLeod (www.smartsound.com/royalty-free-music/i­ncompetech)\n\n#CGQuarterly #LaunchVids #Nintendo64"

        "description": "This is a critical review/rant of the Kingdom Hearts series as a whole, but with a particular emphasis on the disconnect between gameplay and story in Dream Drop Distance, as well as an analysis of the general decline of the writing quality as the series goes on. It's not a traditional review though, as it assumes the viewer has some degree of familiarity with most of the games in the series. The style and format of the video is inspired by channels like Sequilitis and SomecallmeJohnny, so it may emulate them in certain areas.\n\nFurthermore, I don't own any video-capture equipment for handheld games and wasn't about to replay the entirety of the series just to capture footage for one 30-minute video anyway, so all the video footage is taken from various other channels, I do not claim credit for them. Also, HUGE thank you to my buddy Eric who helped me physically put this together as I'm not even remotely tech-savvy and couldn't have done it without him!\n\nKingdom Hearts is the property of Square-Enix and Disney, I do not own any part of it and I did not conceive it, blah blah blah, please support the official release.

I had a lot of fun making this and I plan to continue creating more videos on this channel. \n\nThis video discusses the common idea that KH2 is a simple, one-button game, and I go into great detail about why I think this is the case. I cover things like how the game teaches the player, what reasons it gives to use its various mechanics, and why so much still gets ignored in casual play. I also mention how the Final Mix version of the game fits into all of this.\n\nHuge shoutouts to bl00dybizkitz and the entire Kingdom Hearts speedrunning community, as well as VashTSB and the Bonfire Lit crew.

So I put close to another 100 hours into the game over a period of a few months in order to fairly analyse the game, sans hype.

        "description": "Xenoblade Chronicles 2 Is A Super Nintendo Game, Microwave-Mutated For The 2017 Generation\r\n \r\nI played the first 10 hours of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 twice. I made a long video describing the minute details of how the experience made me feel.\r\n \r\n(Warning: This video contains some light spoilers for the prologue chapter of Xenoblade Chronicles 2.)\r\n \r\nOne word to describe how I feel about this game would be \"weird.\" This is because I played the game with the English voice acting on. The game gives players the option to decrease the voice volume—or, heck, even mute it—though I kept it right where it was, in the name of maximum hilarity. Nintendo is making the Japanese voice track available as day-one DLC. Day one happens to be tomorrow, and I finished this video today, so you better believe we're gonna hear some of that English voice acting, buddy.\r\n \r\nI've made a bunch of videos since I started working at Kotaku Dot Com back in June of 2017. This video is certainly the longest one so far. I cover a lot of territory in here. So get a drink, kick back, click play, and hang out with me for 20 minutes or so.\r\n \r\nHere are some handy timestamps, if you are, for example, the sort of person who skips cutscenes in your glorious anime RPGs:\r\n \r\n0:00: The intro. (This is where videos tend to start.)\r\n \r\n1:52: The voice acting. (This section contains an unbroken 40-second stretch of battle voices which I have listened to dozens of times and laughed every time.)\r\n \r\n7:25: The art, world-building, and writing. (In which I name-drop Theon Greyjoy and David Mamet, and, yes, in case you're wondering, I do mention the breasts.)\r\n \r\n14:35: The game design. (In which I mention that I could make a one-hour video about JRPG battle systems, and also beg you to not beg me to make that video.)\r\n \r\n20:11: The good stuff. (Of course, I mention the game's brilliant music in here. Fun fact: 90% of the music in this video is actually not from Xenoblade Chronicles 2. I just typed \"Celtic\" into the service we use for royalty-free music. This music may be royalty-free, though I sure feel like a king with fiddling like this!)"

Although the 16-bit generation started in the late summer of 1989 with the near-simultaneous launch of the Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-16, the release of the Super Nintendo in August of 1991 signaled the real start of the 16-bit console war.  The system came bundled with Super Mario World as the pack-in game, and on launch day two additional games were available; F-Zero and Pilotwings.  Many believe that Gradius III and SimCity were also launch titles, but these games were actually released the following week, just missing being part of the launch line-up.   \n\nSpecial thanks for the following people for their support making this episode:\n\nChris Covell (http://www.chrismcovell.com)\nMatt Henzel (http://www.videogameobsession.com)\nDigitalNeohuman (http://www.youtube.com/user/digitalneohuman)\n\nShow Notes:\n\n- At around 7:07 in the video, I accidentally refer to Actraiser as \"Axelay\"  Unfortunately, there is no way to fix this without deleting this video and re-uploading.  I put an annotation in the video, but people watching on non-desktop platforms aren't going to see it.\n\n- Production of this video began the same day that the Sega Saturn launch episode was released; December 25, 2015.  This episode therefore took 7 months to complete, although I took breaks to make the History of NHL '94 and DieHard Gamefan videos.\n\n- The footage of Uemura, the guys working at Nintendo EAD, Miyamoto in his cubicle, and Miyamoto drawing mario (during the end credits) all game from an early 90's French documentary called \"Otaku\". You can check it out here but it isn't in english, unfortunately: https://youtu.be/JWiAEThmnGk\n\n- All of the gameplay footage for this episode was recoded using an RGB-modded SNES mini, as it produces a sharper image than an older \"original\" SNES.\n\n- Graduis III and SimCity WERE NOT LAUNCH TITLES.  I can't stress this enough times.  The three games featured in this episode were the only three that were available on launch day.  Period.\n\n- This was the fifth episode covering the launch of a console.\n\n- I had to re-record the F-Zero footage 4 times because the beta version of the Elgato software that I was using kept dropping the audio.\n\n- I mentioned in the outro to the show that I get my box art from Matt Henzel of VideoGameObsession.com.  I should have said \"much of this comes from...\" because he is not my only source.  He has however given me permission to use any material on his site, and asked only for credit in my videos.  As has always been the case, the bulk of the box art seen on this show comes from The Cover Project.\n\n- I did not play through the complete game when recording Super Mario World footage.  I have beaten the games multiple times in the past, but have received negative comments from viewers for showing too much of some games.  If you haven't beaten SMW, you should do it for yourself instead of watching someone else do it.\n\nSubscribe: \nhttp://goo.gl/qPJtIq\n\nOfficial Classic Gaming Quarterly t-shirts:\nhttp://amzn.to/2aycwli\n\nFacebook: \nhttp://goo.gl/3kDiqt\n\nTwitter: \nhttp://twitter.com/CGQuarterly\n\nPinterest: \nhttp://www.pinterest.com/cgquarterly/\n\nHomepage: \nhttp://www.cgquarterly.com\n\nBox art featured in CGQ videos comes from The Cover Project, fount at thecoverproject.net.

        "description": "Episode 44 -  The launch of the Sega Genesis in 1989.  Sega first entered the home console market in 1983 with the SG-1000, which was released in Asia, Australia, and some parts of Europe.  In 1985, the hardware was upgraded and a new system, the Mark III was released.  This would become the \"Sega Master System\" around the world, and although it was only really successful in Europe and Brazil, it blazed the trail for Sega's next system, the 16-bit Mega Drive.\n\nThe Mega Drive, designed around the Motorola 68000 CPU (previously used in Sega's \"System 16\" arcade hardware\" was released in Japan in November of 1988, and was brought over to North America as the \"Genesis\" less than a year later.  Launching on August 14, 1989, the system came bundled with Altered Beast, and 5 additional games were available on day 1: Space Harrier II, Last Battle, Super Thunder Blade, Tommy Lasorda Baseball, and Thunder Force II.\n\nInitially Sega was competing with NEC's TurboGrafx-16, launched just a week after the Genesis.  But Sega's superior hardware and marketing caused the Turbografx to quickly lose ground.  For 2 years, the Genesis was the only 16-bit home console on the market, until the Super Nintendo was released in the late summer of 1991.  This kicked off the infamous \"16-bit Console War\", which was a back-and-forth affair, with Sega at one point outselling Nintendo, but ultimately aged hardware and poor decisions by Sega of Japan led to Nintendo ultimately winning out. \n\nThe Genesis was succeeded by the Sega Saturn in 1995, and the Dreamcast in 1999.  The former was not a success in North America but was Sega's best-selling system at home.  The Dreamcast was an excellent arcade-at-home system that also had a number of excellent home-exclusive titles, but was ultimately Sega's final entry in the hardware market.\n\nThe Genesis was Sega's most iconic and successful console worldwide.\n\nShow Notes:\n\n- Much of this show was produced in tandem with the Sega Master System launch episode.  \n\n- The original \"Launch of the Sega Genesis\" episode was published on May 4, 2014, and was retired with almost 120,000 views.  That video had comparatively low production value due to its age, which is why it was replaced.\n\n- The System-16 board pictured in this episode is Golden Axe, and was the board used in the \"History of Golden Axe\" episode.\n\n- All arcade footage used in this episode was generated using emulation.  All home console footage was captured from actual hardware.\n\n- The bulk of this episode was produced during a 5-day stretch in which I was working on it up to 16 hours per day.\n\n- I found not one but two ways to sneak references to Ayrton Senna into this episode.\n\nMusic courtesy of Kevin MacLeod (www.smartsound.com/royalty-free-music/i­ncompetech)\n\n#CGQuarterly #LaunchVids #SegaGenesis"

        "description": "https://linktr.ee/cgquarterly\n\nEpisode 43 -  The launch of the Sega Master System in 1986.  This episode includes the history of Sega up through the Master System's launch.\n\nCheck out Paul Driscoll on the RGDS Podcast:\nhttp://retrogamingdailyshow.libsyn.com\n\nAnd buy his new book here:\nhttp://amzn.to/2gCIDCz\n\nEric Fraga's YouTube show \"Cosmic Effect\" can be found here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/CosmicEffectGaming\n\nAnd check out his music page here:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/cosmiceffect\n\nSega was originally founded in the late 40's as \"Service Games\", known in Japan as Nihon Goraku Bussan.  In the mid 1960's, they merged with David Rosen's company \"Rosen Enterprises\", becoming Sega Enterprises, Ltd.  Sega first entered the home video game market with the \"SG-1000\" in 1983.  This console was redesigned, creating the \"Mark II\" in 1984, and the Mark III was released in 1985.  The Mark III was completely (cosmetically) redesigned and released in North America in 1986 as the \"Sega System\", later known as the \"Master System\".  Depending on which bundle you bought, the system came packaged with Hang on and either Astro Warrior or Safari Hunt, the latter bundle also including the Sega Light Phaser.  Five additional games were available for purchase at launch, including Choplifter, Fantasy Zone, World Grand Prix, Transbot, and Ghost House.\n\nIn 1987, the Master System was released in Great Britain by the massively-popular budget software publisher Mastertronic, who up to that point had been focused on releasing low-cost games for British 8-bit home computers like the ZX Spectrum.  Mastertronic was purchased by Richard Branson and folded into the Virgin Group, becoming \"Virgin Mastertronic\".  With little competition from other home console makers, most-notably Nintendo, while the aforementioned 8-bit home computers were beginning to show their age, the Master System went on to capture the lion's share of the market.  The Master System was much more successful in Europe than in the United States, selling more than 3 times as many consoles there.  So successful were Virgin Mastertronic at marketing the Master System, that the company was bought out by Sega in 1991, becoming Sega of Europe.\n\nIn 1989, the Master System was released in Brazil by Tectoy.  Brazil's population was almost as large as the United States, and they had just as much interest in video games, but the country had also been largely ignored by Nintendo.  Arcade games were quite popular;  so popular in fact that Taito had a dedicated Brazilian division of the company.  The Atari 2600 had been released there and achieved success, as well. The Master System was a massive success in Brazil, selling 5 million units which accounts for almost half of total worldwide sales.\n\nWhile the Sega Genesis was ultimately a massive hit in the United States, it was an uphill battle thanks to the relative failure of the Master System here.  But the trail blazed by Sega's 8-bit system in Europe and Brazil made the Mega Drive a much easier sell, and once again Sega beat Nintendo in those territories.\n\nShow Notes:\n\n- I only said \"weekend rental\" once in this episode.\n\n- I made sure to add accurate closed captions, bearing in mind that Eric may be hard for some people to understand due to his Brazilian accent.  These will also make it easier for non-English speakers to watch the show with translated captions, which I am hoping will make it more accessible to the Brazilian audience.\n\n- The original Sega Master System launch lineup has been confirmed by two independent period-published periodicals; the Milwaukee Journal and the \"Computer Entertainer\" newsletter.\n\n- This episode marks the first time that I have had guests on my show.\n\n- This episode marks the first time that I have covered the launch of a true 8-bit system (TG-16 doesn't count!)\n\n- This episode is, to date, the longest launch episode that I have produced.\n\n- Most of the gameplay footage in this episode was created using a Genesis console that has been modified for optimal RGB video quality.  Because the Genesis is not backwards-compatible with SG-1000 games, an unmodified Master System console was used, which is why those games show noticeable \"jail bars\".\n\n- The footage demonstrating Double Dragon with FM sound was generated using a \"Power Base Mini FM\", which is an adapter that allows you to play Master System games on your Genesis while adding FM functionality.  I bought it specifically to use in this episode.  I was also a little bit drunk, which generally makes me loosey-goosey with the CGQ corporate card.\n\n- Speaking of buying stuff for the show, I bought the boxed copies of Hang On/Astro Warrior and Hang On/Safari Hunt just so that I could use them to take the pictures used in this episode.  \n\nMusic courtesy of Kevin MacLeod (www.smartsound.com/royalty-free-music/i­ncompetech)\n\n#CGQuarterly #LaunchVids #SegaMasterSystem"

        "description": "The Sonic & Knuckles saga is a memorable staple Sonic series that is looked upon more positively than other facets of the franchise. It consists of two games released in the same year: Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles. In many cases, these two titles set a bar of high expectations for what would come next from the \"blue blur,\" as 90's marketing would call him. \n\nThere has been much speculation over what it brought to the table story-wise. There has been speculation on the fruitfulness and validity of its fundamental mechanic. There has also been a sizable amount of speculation on what went on during the development of the game. Here is where I try my best (and potentially fail in some parts) to piece together what this saga was with objectivity as the vehicle of conveying information, and a personal passion for the series as a vehicle of getting it out there as cohesively as possible.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @SatchbagSays\nI podcast every week at http://bitbarista.com"

I may or may not do a video on that part of the game in the distant future, but for now I'm sort of Bioshock Infinite-d out.\n\nIt's certainly an odd duck - a game that (when it's hitting the right buttons) is impossible not to love, and there are moments and characters here that are simply inspired.  After I finished the game I couldn't stop thinking about it for days, and not just because of the ending - it was a game that had left some sort of emotional imprint on me.  \n\nAnd yet I had to force myself to keep playing in parts; to remind myself that there was a reason I wanted to finish a given combat section to see what good stuff waited on the other side.  And as I began a second playthrough that curiosity had diminished and I was left with an seething loathing for the bits that prevented me from getting to the parts I cared about.  At that point I realized that Bioshock Infinite is a charming two to three hour exploration adventure game padded out to seven to ten hours with some absolutely insufferable shooting mechanics that betray everything the *Shock series has ever been known for or good at.  To be clear: It's not a \"You changed it from what it used to be!\" thing.  It's more of a \"You took a series of interesting systems and turned them into a stock shooter - worse, a *terrible* stock shooter.  Feel bad about yourselves.\""

I suppose it's healthy to get it out of my system, though.  And honestly few games have earned my ire more this year.\n\nI know that some people will argue that Aiden ostensibly has the option of solving some problems by brutal beatings and not *necessarily* murder, but I think that sort of underscores the point I'm making: on his best days Aiden is a guy who pummels people into submission with a club because his phone said to.  On his worst days he'll shoot purse snatchers in the back as they run away.  But yeah, sure, I'm sure he's a great uncle and everyone should look up to him and he's the next Batman or whatever.  Good job, Ubisoft.\n\nI also didn't find an opportunity to talk about the game's sex trafficking scenes, which sort of sucks because they're *wildly* inappropriate.  I mean, I get that Aiden tries to stop the sex trafficking, but look at how they're framed.  It's ~2 missions completely irrelevant to the rest of the plot that exists more or less for the express purpose of \"check out these boobs.\"  It's completely irrelevant to the main narrative and feels like either a holdover from a bigger side story (see also: Defalt and Pawnee) or it's a crass attempt to meet the \"brothel level\" quota that videogames seem to have these days.  Yuck.\n\nOh, also, I'm turning comments off as part of an experiment to see if it makes the internet a less awful place.  We'll see.  If comments must be made, try in our kinda-almost-new subreddit:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/errantsignal/comments/2elonl/errant_signal_watch_dogs_spoilers/"

It's such a large, expansive game that I can find a million little details and touches to fall in love with - and a whole lot of stuff that does nothing but alienate me."

FRAPS started causing the game to halt for seconds at a time (resulting in useless footage) so I switched over to Bandicam.  Unfortunately that meant that the footage was compressed, which makes sliding around in an editor looking for just the right clip to use super laggy.  This was exacerbated by the game being 25 hours long and an open world that tells its story in somewhat sporadic chunks.  So yeah, editing this thing was a bit of a beast.  I hope you enjoy it!

So I tried to break down exactly why that is in what will probably be as close to a Christmas-y episode as this show can get.\n\nIt's tempting to suggest this is just fanboy whining - that I'm upset that this new Dead Rising isn't like the old Dead Rising.  But I really firmly believe that the new stuff is this awkward mix of stolen mechanics that do little to enhance the core Dead Rising game systems, and all the while the stuff that made Dead Rising... well, Dead Rising has been downplayed more and more with each sequel. \n\nI mean, there are so many interesting places you could take a sequel.  You could lean into the Home Alone thing and put an emphasis on traps and defense more than active combat.  You could take the idea of objects with small sets of clearly defined rules and try to design them to interact and get more of an emergent-y thing going on.  You could keep the gameplay largely the same and double down on the culture commentary - it's probably overworn subject matter at this point, but it'd be *something* to call your own.\n\nInstead we get... detective mode, stealth takedowns, towers to unlock, collectibles to snap pictures of.... ~shakes head~  I'm really curious as to whether the game that got shipped was a rushed title or if it really was the vision for the franchise by Capcom Vancouver, and the increasingly sad thing is I'd believe either. \n\n----\nThis episode was made possible by generous support through Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/errantsignal\n----"

        "description": "Everyone knows Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest was a huge disappointment after Castlevania 1, but why? \n\nIn Sequelitis, I passionately discuss the relationships between video game sequels and their predecessors. I also crack a lot of jokes which may or may not be funny. \n\nGetting a laugh or two out of a video is a-okay with me, but I hope along with it we can open up channels for more intelligent discussion on game making and how designers both young and old can learn from the greats and not-so-greats."

Some positive details are omitted, for instance I like the health reduction when hollowed. That said, my overall feeling is one of overwhelming disappointment.\n\nI've played through the game three times:\nKnight, melee only, latter half in Company of Champions.\nHexer, no shield, participated in all covenants.\nDex, poison build, Company of Champions.\nI feel this has given me a good overview of the different possible builds/covenants. I never record my first playthrough of a game so there's no footage of the Knight.\n\nApologies to everyone I killed as a Rat, for what it's worth I didn't enjoy it either."

If you watched my Dark Souls Series, please let me know which method of presentation that you liked more. There were a few more jokes in this video and my intention was that they wouldn't interrupt the flow of what I was saying and feel natural.\n\nI also uploaded it all as one video instead of broken into parts like Dark Souls. Let me know if you liked this better, or would have preferred parts that you can use as breaks to come back later.\n\nAs I watched this back after uploading it, I noticed that I sound highly critical of Blizzard. They're still one of my favorite developers even after the statements I made at the end of this video. Hopefully I'm wrong with my guesses, or that even if I'm right that the changes will be positive.\n\nThanks for watching! If you like the stuff I do, you might want to subscribe to the channel. If you like me even MORE than that and want to support me (I like you too), the best way would be to check out my books found here:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jph_anderson\n\nBooks: http://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Anderson/e/B006XDCXPI/\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/JosephAnderson"

The first was on the strengths of the series and major changes brought by the sequel. This video is on level design and bosses in the base game. The third will be looking at the same things in the DLC areas.\n\n\nI'm not really satisfied with the quality of this video. I think I should have summarized a lot of the levels in a quick section instead of committing so much time to a very barebones runthrough of them. I say in the video that many levels don't have much going on but it was still my mistake to make a whole video about them.\n\nI guess it makes the series complete in terms of looking at most of the game, but I think this is the least interesting video I've done so far. Hopefully the next one is better.\n\nThanks for watching. Let me know what you think."

If you want to wait for all three to be out before watching this, my current estimate is the second video will be out next week and early January for the third.\n\nThis one is a brief(ish) overview of what makes Dark Souls 1 great and then how that's changed in Dark Souls 2. My goal with these videos is to show that the sequel is a lot closer to the first game in terms of quality than most think, and that the vast majority of problems people have with the sequel are also present in the first game.\n\nThe second video is a sprint-through of the entire game and will likely be the least interesting of the three videos, since level design in the sequel is on the blander side.\n\nThe third video is on the DLC and how the level design is much improved.\n\nMy wife thinks I speak a little too fast in some sections in this video and she hears me talking all the time so she's probably right. I think I should work on slowing down a bit. Let me know if you had a similar issue. Also, if anyone thinks I could still clean up the audio more than I currently do, I'd love to have any tips on how to improve that.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\n\n\nLinks in the video:\n\nMy Dark Souls Critique (audio is pretty bad) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VJCDYtR9B8&list=PLTJr2842sYmIxwGygp9UN5cXiETkrzvdN\n\n\nMatthewmatosis's Dark Souls 2 Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UScsme8didI"

It also needed to be stated for those new to the channel. The majority of this video is still on the newer game though, and the next two videos will expand on what's said.\n\nI think this one ends a little abruptly but that might be because it's one of three. Let me know what you think, and thank you for being patient with these releases. I tend to have my video releases spread throughout the month instead of all bunched at the end like this.
